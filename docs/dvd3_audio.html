<h1>DVD 3 — Raw SRT</h1>
<pre>1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.600
Figure out who's dominating the market. The day timeframe trader, they will buy yesterday's high, they'll sell yesterday's low. The long timeframe or longer timeframe, they could care less.

2
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:35.700
So you start very quickly to understand who's dominating the market today, who's dominating the market, starts to help you identify what your opportunities are.

3
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:51.700
Day timeframe control opens at the edge of the previous day's range, looks beyond the extreme but is contained. So there's the open, the market comes back to one tick above the open. That's all there is to it.

4
00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:08.800
This could have been a bigger, this could have been bigger early on, right? What kind of an opening did I have? I had an open and drive. Okay, open and drive. I went one tick out of balance. Open and drive. It could have been a big day. I don't know early on.

5
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:20.920
When I see this, I want to immediately get what? I want to get long immediately. Okay, I get long and I measure, I monitor the trade for what? Continuation.

6
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.600
As the day goes on, I get back up to the point of control. Remember, it's hard to get away from it. But I start to get no elongation. Okay?

7
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:41.720
When I can't get by this, do I see, do you see any evidence that there is any timeframe other than the daytime frame on the buy side of this market?

8
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:54.160
Longer timeframe. They go through that like a shot. They got back up to everything. Really good traders know where the fairest price or the point of control was from yesterday.

9
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.980
Where did most of the volume take place yesterday? At the point of control. Really good short-term traders, they know that.

10
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:13.080
They automatically know that. And if they didn't write the price down, they just remember it. So we got up there, there wasn't anything there. So now, the market comes down.

11
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.280
We didn't take out the morning. We got to the morning opening exactly and rotated back up. Who do you think is in control of this day?

12
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:32.020
It's all day. It's all day timeframe trading. Now, if you're sitting there trying to make a big trade out of this or trying to find the big trade, guess what?

13
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.140
You're going to get whipped around. You're going to get the whipsaw. You're going to be very disappointed. It's just not there.

14
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.280
So this idea of understanding the behavior of the different timeframes and understanding what timeframe is in control is extremely important.

15
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:59.140
Okay. Other than day timeframe control, prices open in range but move quickly out.

16
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:12.140
So when that starts to happen, you have an indication that if I open within yesterday's range and I start to move pretty quickly and pretty aggressively out of yesterday's range,

17
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.340
is the day timeframe in control? Probably not. At a minimum, it would be what timeframe?

18
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.340
Be the short timeframe or the next longest timeframe in there. It may be, and I don't want to confuse it.

19
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:40.240
Every timeframe has some business to do every day. We are only talking about who is really dominating the market on a particular day.

20
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:52.040
Okay. So you get in this. Also, you can look and see what the value and you just start to get some aggression to the upside by a longer timeframe.

21
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.600
Look at the highs. Do you have a good high up there? And what we define a good high as at least having some kind of selling tail.

22
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:11.400
Okay. When you don't have a good high, I call it a poor high or unsecure. Unsecure is probably not going to be lasting or at least the odds of it being lasting aren't good.

23
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:23.200
Remember, it's not quite that simple. It may be because the market's too long, but for our, we have to learn to walk before we get, you know, more advanced.

24
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:36.220
But if I have, if I have that poor high up there, do I have any evidence that the next longer timeframe came in to start to take advantage of higher prices and sell the market down?

25
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Weren't there, right? They may have been subtly selling something, but they weren't aggressively selling anything.

26
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.080
Those are the clues by organizing the data that's revealed in the structure.

27
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:59.420
If I had a single bar chart, a one dimensional bar chart, think of all the information that I would not be privy to.

28
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.460
I wouldn't see the depth. I wouldn't of the market. I wouldn't see the dynamics that are there.

29
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.720
Okay. Let's go on. Aha. The diffusion model.

30
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.680
Years ago, I used, when I did some lectures years ago, and I'd say to people, let me talk a little bit about the behavior of people.

31
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:37.080
If I had a perfect idea, and I offered that perfect idea to five people in this room, and it was guaranteed that idea was going to make, could make $500 if you bought it today.

32
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.420
Would all five people buy it right now?

33
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.640
More than likely not.

34
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.080
I get one person that's still buying, and then it starts to move up a little bit. It's working.

35
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.280
Then I get somebody else comes along, and they buy it, right?

36
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.480
And of course, the more evidence that it's working, the more people that are willing to buy it.

37
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.280
And finally, the fifth person in the room at the very top can't stand it anymore, and they buy it, right?

38
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.020
Does that go on in markets? Has it happened to us? Of course it has.

39
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.980
So I used to use that for a long time.

40
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.860
Then this guy, Malcolm Gladwell came along, and I forget which book this was in.

41
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.360
Was this in The Tipping Point or Blink?

42
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.660
Tipping Point.

43
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.740
Tipping Point.

44
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.240
And what he did was he gave it a name, and he put numbers behind it, which people love, right?

45
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.160
They love a label, and one, two, three, four, five, and give each one a label.

46
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.580
Incidentally, Gladwell's got about four books out there.

47
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.600
They are wonderful, wonderful reads.

48
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.140
He is one of the best I've ever known that has the ability to go out.

49
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.340
And he really takes other people's research, and he packages in a very, very wonderful way.

50
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.800
It's The Tipping Point.

51
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.580
It's Blink.

52
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.700
The newest one is What the Dogs Saw.

53
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.420
But they're great for understanding the markets and people.

54
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.200
The diffusion model is talking about here.

55
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.720
It's the same thing I talked about for years.

56
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.400
You just put a label.

57
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.680
The innovator.

58
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.480
The innovator is the first person in.

59
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.720
Okay?

60
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.740
So, when I was a kid, they had, that's all I really know when I was a kid was the Airstream.

61
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.340
You know, they were the innovators.

62
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.040
Before we go here, and incidentally, innovators usually are not corporations and big organizations.

63
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.460
Big organizations make decisions how?

64
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.760
Through committees, right?

65
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.400
Committees don't take big risks.

66
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.100
I was one of them for a number of years.

67
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.600
Innovators.

68
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.920
Innovators are normally individuals.

69
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.440
Pretty independent.

70
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.120
Think about the name you hear a lot about the mortgage business.

71
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.620
You hear about this guy Paulson.

72
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.760
Made a billion dollars for himself, and I forget how many billion for, you know, the clients of his hedge fund.

73
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.380
It was his own hedge fund.

74
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.800
He called the shots, right?

75
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.700
He was the guy that was short the mortgage market.

76
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:07.060
And some of these, one of these new great books written by the guy, Michael Lewis, that wrote The Blind Side.

77
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.400
The Big Short.

78
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.380
It's a great book.

79
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.140
But, you know, he was the innovator.

80
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.240
He got involved in shorting the mortgage market and made a lot of money.

81
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.900
So the innovator is early, early to the party, usually fairly independent, usually very smart.

82
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.000
Some risk.

83
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.020
Sometimes they're wrong.

84
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.280
There are, there's a firm no longer exists anymore, Bear Stearns.

85
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.860
Bear Stearns for years never wanted to be the innovator.

86
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.000
What they would do is they would wait until somebody else was in and had a good idea.

87
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:45.260
Then they would come along and they wanted to be what Gladwell would call the early adopter.

88
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:53.020
After they saw there was some risk taken out of it, big manufacturing companies, drug companies, they go along and they buy people that are already underway.

89
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.200
So you get the innovator.

90
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.280
Then you get the early adopter.

91
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:12.420
And we walked, we walked through this and just kind of taking a look at the, what's going on in the, in the recreational vehicle market.

92
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:22.420
And one of the things, you've got the innovators, the early adopters, they enter the market, they identify that change is underway.

93
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.760
And where did a lot of this take place?

94
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.360
Um, let's go, let's go.

95
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.340
Let's look at the, uh, at the next, no, the first, second, third, late majority.

96
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:40.740
A lot of this real growth happened following 9-11.

97
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:41.880
Okay.

98
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.880
Following 9-11 for people vacation.

99
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.120
What did they, what were they feeling about airplane traffic?

100
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.080
Air, traveling by plane.

101
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.940
They weren't as comfortable, right?

102
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.760
So people kind of changed, changed how they did things.

103
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.900
They changed, they changed, um, their vacation.

104
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:09.820
We got in and we got more mobile homes, uh, more, uh, recreational vehicles, more manufacturers, more people in the party.

105
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.980
So we had the innovator been around for a long time.

106
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.040
You know, the, the, the Airstream.

107
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.880
Uh, and we see this in the market all the time.

108
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.880
Everybody knows, everybody knows what it's all about, right?

109
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.400
And they're, everybody's coming in, they're buying every break.

110
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.960
And I just love this.

111
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.840
I live, I live in, uh, Prescott, Arizona.

112
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.900
So I live out west.

113
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.720
You actually have places that look like this out west.

114
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.040
Where you just look over the tops of these, uh, of these things.

115
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.120
Matter of fact, we have the innovator.

116
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.360
Okay.

117
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.620
Follow the innovator.

118
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.960
We have, which would really be two, the early adopters.

119
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.560
These are still intelligent people, but they let it get underway first.

120
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.960
They get on the trend fairly early.

121
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:54.960
Okay.

122
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.560
So when they get on, the buying tail's already gone, right?

123
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.140
The buying tail is the, uh, is the innovator.

124
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.980
The early adopter is when you're starting to get the structure is forming a little bit.

125
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.260
Then you go on and you get the early majority would be three.

126
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.440
The late majority would be four.

127
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.920
And we saw our late majority.

128
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.560
Everybody's in almost, right?

129
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.680
We got almost everybody in.

130
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:24.320
And then you finally get to the final stage, which is stage five, where you get the laggards.

131
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.600
And you see this all the time in markets, right?

132
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.620
I mean, think about this behavior.

133
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.660
All of a sudden, you know, they know you cannot do anything but own the market.

134
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.480
And when you look at this, you see the years, um, you see the growth.

135
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.300
And then you see what happens to the laggards.

136
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.180
They're almost always late to the party.

137
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.800
Um, when you look at a market, let's say, let's say this market.

138
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.580
Say you got a market that's going up.

139
00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:07.640
When the tie is finally made, you got the laggard, the final laggard short covers.

140
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.740
So you got a market that's going up.

141
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.840
The final stage, you get the laggard shorts that are covering.

142
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.700
Combined with the laggard longs that never got on board.

143
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.880
So you got two laggards up there.

144
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.360
Met by, and who meets those people?

145
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.600
The innovator.

146
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.940
The innovators meet those people.

147
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.060
So when the mortgage market was going down, when the mortgage market was, was going, was,

148
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.980
when the mortgage market was at its peak to be shorted.

149
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:37.740
Okay.

150
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.000
And you had these people flipping homes.

151
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.180
Uh, my sister lives in Naples, Florida.

152
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.580
One of the women down there, you know, had 50 homes she was owning, trying to flip.

153
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.860
Can't understand why she went bankrupt.

154
00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:48.820
Okay.

155
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.760
Who came in?

156
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.460
Paulson came in as the innovator shorting the mortgage market.

157
00:12:53.460 --> 00:13:00.540
So it's understanding, understanding that is part of behavior, how we operate.

158
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.980
We see it in the daytime frame.

159
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.140
We see it in the short timeframe.

160
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.820
We see it in the intermediate timeframe.

161
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.800
We see it in the long timeframe.

162
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.760
When the market broke in 08, the market was off substantially.

163
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.760
Uh, it was getting weaker, getting weaker, getting weaker.

164
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.920
It was off substantially before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, because the thing was just coming

165
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.280
apart.

166
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:35.000
Then the volume for the last part of the market was huge, because guess what?

167
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:41.580
The longest timeframes were now liquidating the market.

168
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.580
The longest timeframes were the final laggards that took the market.

169
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.180
And then after they were done, with huge volume, after they were done, the market moved back up

170
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.420
from March of last year until just recently.

171
00:13:54.420 --> 00:14:00.020
So that process goes on for all timeframes within the market.

172
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.140
But I did a, uh, I did a webinar for, uh, uh, Linda Ratzky one time.

173
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:14.220
And I was trying to convey the emotions that we go through as traders in the marketplace.

174
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.180
And what I'm thinking about is the pari-mutual betting.

175
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:26.740
And let's assume, let's assume that instead of closing the board, we leave the board open.

176
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.220
And we leave the tote board open until, uh, just a couple of seconds before the final horse

177
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.160
crosses the, uh, crosses the line.

178
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.160
Okay.

179
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.160
As you're watching the, as you're watching the race and it becomes clearer and clearer

180
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160
who the winner is going to be.

181
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.160
If the, if the, you can still bet, where is all the money going to be?

182
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.160
It's going, it's going to the leader, right?

183
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.160
And how much thought you get so wrapped up in this auction process.

184
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:05.160
How much thought do you think you're going to give to what the payoff is?

185
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160
There it goes.

186
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
You can place your bet at any time.

187
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.160
And of course, you're coming into the far turn up by six and a half lengths.

188
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160
They're widening the length.

189
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.160
There's nobody coming from behind.

190
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.160
You can still bet how much money is going into the betting pool.

191
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160
Okay.

192
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.160
How do we determine the payout?

193
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160
By the amount of the what?

194
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160
Money bets.

195
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.160
The amount of the pool, right?

196
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
What do you think the winnings are good for every $2?

197
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
You're going to get what about $2 and a penny.

198
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
Now think about the risk.

199
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.160
Your five, your five lengths from the finish line.

200
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
Horse stumbles.

201
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.160
You could have made a penny and you lose it all, right?

202
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
But guess what?

203
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
People get so caught up in the auction process.

204
00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:08.160
They get so caught up in this diffusion model and how people, how they act and their behavior that they forget all about the risk they're taking and what the payoff is going to be.

205
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
That is not made in jest.

206
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.160
That happens in the markets every day.

207
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160
So I just want to throw that as an example.

208
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
I want you to think about the diffusion model.

209
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:27.160
And then of course when you, one day you wake up and you bought the high for the day or you sold the low for the day and you say, oh my golly, I'm a ligard.

210
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.160
You know, it's really probably not something you're going down to the local pump to brag about.

211
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.160
But anybody that's traded for any period of time has been there.

212
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.160
Um, it's human, this human behavior plays out continually.

213
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160
There are two well known names in the educational world.

214
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.160
Amos Tversky has passed on.

215
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.160
Daniel Kahneman is still teaching at Princeton.

216
00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:01.160
They won the Nobel Prize in economics for what they labeled.

217
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:09.160
Um, I'm forgetting the, I'm forgetting the name of what they, prospect theory, what they called prospect theory.

218
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.160
Ask Kahneman one time, how'd you come up with that name?

219
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160
Oh, it means nothing.

220
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
We're just trying to get people's attention.

221
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.160
What the research showed was that markets are irrational.

222
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.160
Surprise, surprise.

223
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:30.160
However, the markets are irrational in a predictable manner.

224
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
Think about the power of that.

225
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.160
Where do you, when we talk about the diffusion model and we talk about the pari mutual board and everything else,

226
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.160
and we talk about, you know, getting trapped where we buy the high or sell the low.

227
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.160
Uh, was it rational? No, but it certainly was predictable because that's the human behavior.

228
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
That's what people do.

229
00:17:49.160 --> 00:18:00.160
The better you understand that, the better you understand that, the better you can fend off getting trapped into the same process emotionally yourself.

230
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.160
And this happens no matter how experienced the trader is.

231
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.160
You will from time to time fall into these traps.

232
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:19.160
One of the, the most important things you can do in order to prepare for any day is identify references.

233
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.160
Some of these references will be daytime frame references.

234
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
Some will be short time frame.

235
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
And short time frame reference would be defined as what?

236
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.160
Three to five.

237
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.160
Three to five days.

238
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.160
Intermediate term references and long term references.

239
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
So you can categorize the references.

240
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:46.160
All I want to do is kind of whet your appetite to them and let's kind of look at a list of some of the reference, um, that we're, that we're talking about.

241
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.160
Um, some are fairly easy.

242
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.160
The prior session, high or low.

243
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160
Okay.

244
00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:01.160
Another one that you may not be as familiar with is the overnight trading.

245
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.160
The most of these markets trade overnight in the electronic market.

246
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:13.160
The overnight high and low are significant reference points.

247
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.160
I don't pay much attention to anything else overnight.

248
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.160
I do pay attention to the overnight high and to the overnight low.

249
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160
Uh, there's some other things that are, um, involved.

250
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
I'm not going to go into those right now.

251
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.160
Um, I look at the close or what is called unchanged.

252
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.160
There's not a short term trader in the world that doesn't know what unchanged is.

253
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.160
Um, which would be last night's close.

254
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
POC.

255
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.160
Another word for POC is what?

256
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
Fairest price to?

257
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.160
To conduct business.

258
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.160
The rally high or pull back low.

259
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.160
Early this morning, we had a trend day going up late in the afternoon.

260
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.160
One of our references was the pull back low.

261
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.160
Okay.

262
00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:03.160
If the market was going in the opposite direction, the market was breaking, trend day breaking, and then you had a rally high.

263
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.160
That rally high would also be a reference.

264
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:18.160
One of the reasons we use references, because if change is going to take place, change is more than likely going to take place relative to a reference.

265
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.160
Trading, incidentally, is about change.

266
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.160
Without change, without change, there's no opportunity.

267
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
The question now, we're looking at how big is the change?

268
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.160
Or what could it be?

269
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.160
So, we've got the rally high or low.

270
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.160
We've got bracket highs or lows.

271
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:41.160
And incidentally, I'll confuse everybody tremendously, because I use interchangeably.

272
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.160
Trading range higher lows, bracket higher lows, they're all the same thing.

273
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.160
I generally think of trading ranges as being smaller.

274
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.160
So, let's say you've got a 10-day balance back and forth.

275
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.160
And I tend to think of brackets as being, you know, several weeks or longer.

276
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160
But I interchange the two.

277
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.160
But looking from the top of a balance area to the bottom of a balance area.

278
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:11.160
So, if you've got a 10-day range from the top to the bottom, would be that trading range or bracket high or low.

279
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.160
Spikes, we haven't talked about spikes yet.

280
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160
We will talk about spikes.

281
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.160
They happen late in the day.

282
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.160
And we'll talk about those in a second.

283
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:30.160
The current session opening price, where today's market opens, becomes a daytime frame reference.

284
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:38.160
And important, particularly on those days when the market is controlled by the daytime frame or short-term traders.

285
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.160
Half back.

286
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:50.160
So, if a market has a range of, say, 1 to 10 in the morning, 5 would be half back or someplace in between 5 and 6 would be half back.

287
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:59.160
On a day when the market is being controlled by short-time frame traders, you'll find that half back becomes a very important reference.

288
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:05.160
And it sounds kind of crazy, but it's kind of the way the world works out there.

289
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.160
Double distribution ranges.

290
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.160
You saw a double distribution trend day early this morning.

291
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.160
And I said the lower and the upper distribution traded as separate days.

292
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:23.160
But also, the bottom of each of those distributions, the top of each distributions, and the single prints that separate the two distributions.

293
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.160
Those are all ranges.

294
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.160
Then we have longer term references.

295
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.160
And they come from the daily charts, from the weekly charts, and from the monthly charts.

296
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:40.160
So, there's a tremendous amount of work that you go through in order to identify references.

297
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:51.160
The longer the reference, the longer the reference, the more likely the change is going to be initiated by a longer time frame.

298
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.160
And the more likely the change is going to be relatively significant.

299
00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.160
Can we go to CQG for just a minute and look at gold?

300
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.160
Sure.

301
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160
I'm told that I was looking at gold the other day.

302
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.160
And one of the reasons I was looking at gold was because there's a lot of momentum trading going on in the market.

303
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160
Momentum traders trade a lot of gold.

304
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.160
They trade a lot of crude oil.

305
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160
They trade a lot of stocks.

306
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.160
They don't trade a lot of treasury bonds.

307
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.160
So, there's just certain kind of markets that the momentum traders like.

308
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.160
One of the markets that they like a lot is gold.

309
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.160
If you will hit comma M on there.

310
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160
Go to bar chart.

311
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160
Go to bar chart.

312
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.160
And if you look at bar chart.

313
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.160
Okay.

314
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.160
Now we're looking at the daily.

315
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.160
No, we're looking at the monthly.

316
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.160
We're looking at the monthly chart for gold.

317
00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
Okay.

318
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
Come across the old high.

319
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:51.160
If I looked at that reference off of a monthly chart, would I call that a day time frame?

320
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.160
No.

321
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
Would I call it a short time frame reference?

322
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
No.

323
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.160
Would I call it a short time frame reference?

324
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.160
No.

325
00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.160
Would I call it an intermediate time frame reference?

326
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160
No.

327
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.160
I would call it a long time frame reference.

328
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.160
What time frame is responsible for breaking a market out into new territory?

329
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.160
If you're at a market high, what time frame is responsible for breaking it into new ground?

330
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.160
The long time frame, right?

331
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160
Okay.

332
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.160
Now, what did we have go on today in gold?

333
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.160
Gold is up, what, 2280?

334
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.160
Gold's up 2280?

335
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.160
We had a breakout.

336
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.160
We had a long, that reference.

337
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160
And we were talking about gold the other day.

338
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
We had that reference.

339
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.160
So, we had an upside breakout in the longest time frame with gold.

340
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.160
That's how we would use that reference.

341
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:50.160
Now, again, I talk about, we're not about mechanical trades, but there are some trades that you must

342
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160
do.

343
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.160
When you have a market that comes out of one of those ranges or out of a balance area, you've got to put your orders in.

344
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.160
You've got to go with those trades.

345
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:05.160
If you're, in fact, going to be a trader and you're going to be successful over a long period of time.

346
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.160
When you break out of a market like that, we're up 2280.

347
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.160
Okay?

348
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.160
Now, think of the mentality, and I referred to this earlier.

349
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.160
Some people would say, oh my golly, I can't buy gold here.

350
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160
The risk is too high.

351
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.160
I'm not buying gold at new highs.

352
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.160
Okay?

353
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.160
And I'm sitting there saying, there's actually less risk once it's broken out.

354
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.160
On the side before you break out, the risk is heavy.

355
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.160
Once you break out, the risk is light.

356
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160
Forget the price.

357
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.160
Once it's broke out, it's into new ground.

358
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.160
It's into new ground.

359
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.160
You've got new players, new ball game.

360
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.160
You need to go with that.

361
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.160
You need to go with that trade.

362
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:53.160
There's actually less risk buying the breakout today than there was buying it before we broke out.

363
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.160
Before it breaks out, it may not make it, and the traders may come in and slam it down.

364
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.160
Once it gets into new ground, guess what?

365
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.160
Are they going to be bidding or offering?

366
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.160
You go into new ground, they're bidding.

367
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.160
And when you have a market that is well bid, you don't have any risk.

368
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.160
As long as there's bidders in there, you don't have any risk.

369
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:18.160
For example, the auctioneer, you hear the auctioneer say, I have 93, I have 94, I have 95, 97.

370
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.160
97, new bidder.

371
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.160
Okay?

372
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.160
When that process is going on, guess what?

373
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.160
We're going higher.

374
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.160
That auction's not over.

375
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.160
Anyhow, let's go back to the references.

376
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.160
I just, we have been following gold.

377
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160
We've been working on references.

378
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:38.160
And I wanted to show you one in real time that broke out, broke out today.

379
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.160
Reference, one of the nice things about references.

380
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.160
We talked earlier and we said there's a tremendous correlation between performance and preparation.

381
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.160
And we see that in any kind of skill-based activity.

382
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.160
Whether it be sports, whether it be music, or any, or anything else.

383
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.160
So there is that kind of thing.

384
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:09.160
You can prepare, you can prepare for the references before the market opens, right?

385
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:15.160
You have the ability to do that in preparation for today's trading.

386
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:24.160
If you aren't prepared, and you're trying to do this once the market opens, the chances of being successful are very small.

387
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.160
You're trying to focus on the market, you're trying to see where in balance, out of balance.

388
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.160
You're not prepared.

389
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.160
This is something you can always do ahead of time.

390
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160
Okay?

391
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.160
Let's take a look.

392
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160
Day timeframe references.

393
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.160
We said earlier, that's what they look like.

394
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.160
The overnight, high or low.

395
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.160
So, the open.

396
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.160
The open is always a daytime frame reference.

397
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.160
Everybody, every short-term trader knows where the market opens.

398
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.160
And they're looking to see are we going up or down from the open.

399
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.160
We've already talked about the point of control.

400
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.160
Okay?

401
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.160
Now just one more thing on the point of control.

402
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160
Fairest price to do business.

403
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:08.160
The more prominent, meaning reading from left to right, the more prominent the point of control is,

404
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.160
the higher the odds that we will regress back to that price at some later date.

405
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.160
For example, we saw this before, but look up here.

406
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
The market opened.

407
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.160
We went within one tick of the point of control, or the fairest price.

408
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.160
It's hard to get away from it.

409
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.160
Another reference that we talked earlier about half-back, right?

410
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160
Another reference.

411
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160
There's another reference.

412
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160
The pull-back low.

413
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.160
We've seen before.

414
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160
A close.

415
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.160
Those are all daytime frame references.

416
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160
Okay?

417
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:46.160
So, if you label them, and what I'm suggesting to now, and I just thought about this a few days ago.

418
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.160
Instead of just, we used to just put in references.

419
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:57.160
Now I'm suggesting, not only do you put in the reference, but if it's half-back, just put in daytime frame reference.

420
00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.160
You remind yourself, it's a daytime frame reference.

421
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.160
Okay?

422
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.160
The shorter the time frame, the less significant the reference is going to be.

423
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.160
If you're the shorter term trader, it's going to be very significant.

424
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.160
If you're a long-term trader, you could care less about the daytime frame references.

425
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.160
A lot of times, they refer to those as noise.

426
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.160
Okay?

427
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.160
Let's take a look and go a step further.

428
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.160
More daytime frame trade.

429
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160
Excess.

430
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.160
A buying tail, or a selling tail, has another name for it.

431
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.160
It's called excess.

432
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.160
So, when a market goes too high, let's say we see a market that runs up, it goes too high, and sells off quickly.

433
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.160
It was the end of the auction.

434
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.160
We call that excess.

435
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:50.160
Excess is one of the two most important concepts you will ever deal with in what we're talking about.

436
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.160
Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction.

437
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.160
And is it daytime frame excess?

438
00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.160
Excess?

439
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160
Is it long time frame excess?

440
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.160
We'll talk more about it, but excess is important in all time frames.

441
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160
We talked about double distribution ranges.

442
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160
Single print ranges.

443
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.160
Excess on the bottom.

444
00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.160
So, we just keep working through this idea of daytime frame references.

445
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:22.160
Let's go on and see what more daytime frame references are.

446
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160
The spike.

447
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160
Okay?

448
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.160
When we're talking here, this late break, and usually the spike is actually bigger than that.

449
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.160
The definition of a spike.

450
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.160
A spike is something that happens late in the day.

451
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.160
Either on the upside or the downside.

452
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.160
Relatively close to the close.

453
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.160
And it is another way to think of a spike.

454
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160
It's a probe.

455
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.160
A market either probing higher or probing lower.

456
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160
Okay?

457
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.160
And we call it a spike.

458
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160
It happens late in the day.

459
00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:01.160
And a lot of times, there's not enough time left to know if it was a valid probe.

460
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:08.160
In other words, was it a price probe that was accepted or was it a price probe that was rejected?

461
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:16.160
If the probe is to the downside, for example, then the top of the spike, the top of the spike,

462
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.160
would be what traditionally would be referred to as resistance.

463
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.160
If it's to the upside, the bottom of the spike would be called support.

464
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.160
Again, there's short-term references in there.

465
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:35.160
What we're looking for the following morning, to see if that price probe was accepted or rejected.

466
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:43.160
If the market is auctioning higher and we have a late price probe to the upside, the market is looking for what?

467
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.160
It's looking for sellers, right?

468
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:52.160
So the question is, did the market go high enough to look for the sellers that it was attempting to find?

469
00:31:52.160 --> 00:32:01.160
So if we open below the spike the following morning, we have excess and the market went high enough to find the sellers that it was searching for.

470
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.160
If we open within the spike, the market did a pretty good job of finding acceptance.

471
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.160
It went to the level where they found sellers.

472
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.160
Some two-sided trade can take place.

473
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:19.160
If we open above the spike, the market didn't go high enough to attract the sellers it was looking for late in the previous day.

474
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:25.160
Also, we may start looking now at a three-day balance.

475
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:32.160
So here we have a three-day trading range and we're going to have the high and the low of that three-day trading range.

476
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.160
It becomes a reference.

477
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.160
Okay, the high and the low of the three-day trading range.

478
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.160
Is it a day timeframe reference or is it a short-term reference?

479
00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.160
It's a short-term reference.

480
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:48.160
And remember, short-term timeframe is three to five days, maybe a little longer.

481
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.160
So start labeling as a short-term reference.

482
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.160
A short-term reference is going to have more significance than is a day timeframe reference.

483
00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:04.160
So if you break out of a three-day balance, okay, it's broken out not by the day timeframe trade.

484
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.160
It's broken out by at least the next longer timeframe, which would be the short timeframe.

485
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:20.160
Just while we're here, the longer the balance has existed, the higher the odds that the move or the opportunity will be meaningful.

486
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.160
Okay, now when you have balance, I should cover it.

487
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.160
Like I say, there's nothing simple about what we do.

488
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.160
When you have a three-day balance, you have three things that can happen.

489
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.160
You come in on the fourth day, the market can remain in balance, right?

490
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:48.160
When a market remains in balance and it trades from the top to the bottom of the balance, no matter three days, five days, etc., that is a short-term trader's paradise.

491
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.160
They love that kind of trading.

492
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.160
So, one, it could stay within the balance.

493
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.160
Secondly, it could look above the balance and fail, right?

494
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.160
It attempts to go out of balance, it fails.

495
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:08.160
If it attempts to go out of balance and fail, that usually sets up a pretty good opportunity in the opposite direction.

496
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.160
Another term will introduce what I call a destination trade.

497
00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.160
It looks above the balance and fails.

498
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:19.160
The destination trade, or at least the target, becomes the opposite end of the balance.

499
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160
Okay?

500
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.160
So, one, it stays within balance.

501
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.160
Two, it looks above the balance and fails.

502
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.160
Three, it breaks out of the balance and goes.

503
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:39.160
So, if you're coming in today and you've got a three-day balance, you're doing your homework tonight, you ought to be prepared for at least those three scenarios.

504
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:46.160
So, you're going to have the reference, you're going to have daytime frame reference, and you're going to have the reference of the three-day high and low.

505
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.160
So, if you come in, part of being prepared, you say, okay, what am I going to do if it stays within the balance?

506
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160
What am I going to do if it looks above it and fails?

507
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.160
What am I going to do if it looks above it and goes?

508
00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:02.160
So, at least you have prepared for three likely scenarios on the following day.

509
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:14.160
You are going to be very much harder to compete against when you come in prepared with your references and prepared with scenarios that you might find of interest the following days.

510
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:25.160
So, if you're coming in today and you've got a three-day balance, you're doing your homework tonight, you ought to be prepared for at least those three scenarios.

511
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:32.160
So, you're going to have the reference, you're going to have daytime frame reference, and you're going to have the reference of the three-day high and low.

512
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:38.160
So, if you come in, part of being prepared, you say, okay, what am I going to do if it stays within the balance?

513
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.160
What am I going to do if it looks above it and fails?

514
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.160
What am I going to do if it looks above it and goes?

515
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:48.160
So, at least you have prepared for three likely scenarios on the following day.

516
00:35:48.160 --> 00:36:00.160
You are going to be very much harder to compete against when you come in prepared with your references and prepared with scenarios that you might find of interest the following days.

517
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.160
Okay, let's take a look at the next reference.

518
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.160
Another reference are anomalies.

519
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:24.160
Remember, a little while ago, we had a market up here, and off to the right, we had one set of TPOs, meaning time price opportunities, reading from left to right, that was stuck out like a rough edge farther than anything else on the profile.

520
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.160
And I said yesterday when I was talking about this, I'm sure several people in the audience are saying, okay, get on.

521
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160
It's one price, it's one line.

522
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.160
What was the high?

523
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160
We looked in the market today.

524
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.160
The high was right up at exactly at that anomaly.

525
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:42.160
So, it's another reference, and it may not be tomorrow, but I keep them.

526
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.160
And all it is, it's when the structure lacked symmetry.

527
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.160
When you have a good structure, there will be some kind of symmetry.

528
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:59.160
When you start to see it lacks symmetry, you start to say, wait a minute, the trading wasn't smooth, maybe it was a little forced.

529
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.160
Very often, it will come back and smooth out that symmetry.

530
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.160
Okay, let's take a look at some more references.

531
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.160
Time frame.

532
00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.160
So, intermediate time frame reference.

533
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:24.160
So, we look up here, if we're using a longer term chart, when you look up there, you say, okay, it doesn't take a genius to pull up a bar chart and say that's the highest the market's been in some period of time, right?

534
00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.160
You look up there, that's going to be an intermediate term reference.

535
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:44.160
Then you may sit there and say, okay, over here, look within that, if I take this as the bottom of the trading range, the intermediate, and the top, I look in here, then I have a short term trading range in the center of it.

536
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.160
Okay?

537
00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.160
So, I can have a short term reference, which is 3 to 5 days, within the intermediate time frame.

538
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.160
Right in here, I can have another short term reference.

539
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.160
Down here, at the low of that range, I have an intermediate term reference on the bottom.

540
00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.160
I have an intermediate term reference on the top.

541
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.160
Then I can kind of calculate the center of the range, and you say, well, why would you do that?

542
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.160
It's just something I do to help me keep perspective.

543
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:21.160
Where am I trade location on an intermediate term trade relative to the top and the bottom of that intermediate term trading range or bracket?

544
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.160
Then I can see I have another short term.

545
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.160
I got a 3-day balance in there.

546
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:33.160
So, I continually go through and mark my charts with reference points.

547
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.160
I print them out, I keep them next to my computer.

548
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:42.160
If I do this, a lot of times I'll do this on the weekend, so I don't have a lot to update during the week.

549
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160
Okay?

550
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.160
Let's take a look at what else we've got in here.

551
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.160
Longer term reference, okay?

552
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.160
This is a monthly bar.

553
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:55.160
Here's the intermediate term reference at $85 on crude.

554
00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160
Okay?

555
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.160
So, that is a monthly basis.

556
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.160
It's going to be, what?

557
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.160
A nine month?

558
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:07.160
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

559
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.160
I guess that's a 19 month high up there.

560
00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160
That's a long term reference.

561
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160
Okay?

562
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:17.920
taken out that reference? We took out that reference, I think, didn't we trade up to

563
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:23.540
the $87 range? You know, in there? Now, so if I look above a reference and go, I look

564
00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:31.240
above a reference and fail, it keeps me, it keeps my perspective in the marketplace. We

565
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.020
could go on a long time talking about these references. What I'm trying to do in this

566
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:43.020
video is introduce you to the concepts that you then go back and you study on your own

567
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:48.200
and start to decide if they make sense and do you understand them and you make them relative

568
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:55.180
to the time frame that you're interested in. A lot of times, a mistake that a lot of short-term

569
00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:02.340
traders make and the reason I talk so much about short-term trading, our audience, there's

570
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.980
more short-term traders than there are long-term traders. So our audience tends to be larger

571
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:13.900
on the short time frame. The biggest mistake that short-term traders make is forgetting

572
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:21.220
about where the longer time frame references are. When you get run over in a market, it

573
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:28.260
is usually because you fail to recognize that the market reached a level that brought the,

574
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:34.800
it came to the attention of the short, intermediate or very long time frame trader. And that's

575
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.820
when all of a sudden you say, what in the world happened to this market today? It got to a

576
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.700
level where other time frames were interested, interested in buying, interested in selling,

577
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.000
whatever it is, but they came off the sideline. They came off the sideline and became participants

578
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.820
in the market, started to dominate the market. And you say, I have no idea what happened. Okay,

579
00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:06.820
let's take a look at more longer term references. This is the monthly bar for the crack spread.

580
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:12.360
Okay. And we're up along the long-term reference high. The reference high here at the high is

581
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:20.820
$11.75. Okay. Today, a couple of traders in here trade the crack spread. There's the long-term

582
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:26.820
reference. What we had a big breakout on the crack spread today. What's the high on the crack spread

583
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:38.160
today? $15.38. $15.38. Okay. $11.75 when we did this chart a few days ago, but now we have this big

584
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.700
breakout to the upside $15.38. That's a huge move from a lot. I don't know where it actually broke from,

585
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:50.700
but from $11.75 to today's high. What's that? What's a one lot worth money-wise there? One lot on that spread?

586
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:58.760
$10 a tick. $10 a tick. $10 a tick. That's a huge move. You see what happens? The importance of

587
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:06.660
understanding these references and when time change, time frame changes, it really can make or break you.

588
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:14.660
Okay. Let's continue. The two most important concepts, I already talked about one. I talked about excess.

589
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:26.660
Excess and balance. Excess happens in all time frames, whether it be five minutes, 30 minutes, daily, monthly, yearly.

590
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:39.660
Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction. Excess is the moment of greatest risk.

591
00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:51.660
It is also the moment of greatest reward if you are positioned correctly. If a market makes an excess high and falls away from it very quickly,

592
00:42:51.660 --> 00:43:00.660
like if you went to a good auction and the auctioneer did it really did a wonderful job. He takes it up and he squeezes the last bit out of the auction.

593
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:08.660
And we said the example we used earlier, say you got $150 for it or $150,000, whatever it is. And he said, oh, by the way, I've got one more.

594
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:17.660
If he did a really good auction, that second one shouldn't go for any more than about $125,000, right? If he completed the auction, it should fall away from there quickly.

595
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:30.660
That's what excess does. This is all about the auction process, right? So when you get an excess high, whether it be daily, weekly, monthly, hourly, you walk up, you've completed the auction, you fall away from it very quickly.

596
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:46.660
If in fact, if in fact you get short with that, you're in a great position. If you stay long, it's the greatest risk you're going to take because you've just had a change in auctions and your position in the wrong way.

597
00:43:46.660 --> 00:44:06.660
Now, when you look at that on paper, it sounds pretty simple. However, keep in mind, when the auction goes up, let's say the excess happens on the high, the excess is going to occur in the face of the most recent market activity.

598
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:22.660
So what your eyes just saw was a market making a new high. It falls away from it. And I'm telling you what your position should be short now. How hard is that trade to do? You know better. You just saw the market going up, right?

599
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:36.660
So you have to work with this concept for a period of time to appreciate the power of it. But if you relate it to the auction process and say, wait a minute, once the auction is over, it ought to drop away from it very quickly.

600
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:58.540
Okay, the second, the second concept that is so powerful. And again, these are two concepts you can walk out of here and use tomorrow. A lot of the things we talk about, there's more ambiguity, there's more context, you have to take them and you have to make them part of your daily trading and part of your life for a long period of time before they become internalized.

601
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:12.500
But balance, when you come out of balance, the market is starting a new auction. So it is the start of a new auction. Again, it is the moment of greatest risk and the moment of greatest opportunity.

602
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:27.820
We talked about the crack spread breaking to the upside. Okay, it was almost four bucks above what the four bucks or 40 cents above what we were at just a few days ago. Okay.

603
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:43.080
If you sit down and we looked at gold, gold was up $22.80 today, we saw it break above a new high, right? You came out of balance. You started a new auction. Moment of greatest risk, moment of greatest opportunity.

604
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:52.960
A lot of greatest opportunity. A lot of greatest opportunity. A lot of greatest opportunity. A lot of times, it is easy to talk about. It is very hard to execute because it flies in the face of what you have been seeing.

605
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.660
and we tend to, unless we have worked on our imagination,

606
00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.400
unless we've worked on these concepts,

607
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.860
it is really hard to go against something you've just seen.

608
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.060
Or if it breaks to the upside and it's a new breakout,

609
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.080
you're being asked to pay 12 for something you could have paid 10 for yesterday.

610
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.220
So I'm not doing that. I'm no fool.

611
00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.880
And those are the really big trades. Those are the big opportunities.

612
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.640
So that's excess imbalance. Two very, very important concepts.

613
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:29.280
Okay. Balance. Approximately, and I ask you to do this on your own.

614
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.700
I don't care if it's monthly, weekly, or anything else.

615
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.040
About 85% of the days will have some meaningful overlap with each other.

616
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.580
How many people in here trade options?

617
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.400
Okay. A few people trade options.

618
00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.740
Part of the problem with trading options is the loss of time premium.

619
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.180
You know, and a lot of that happens because of the overlap,

620
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.800
the days and overlap and the time premium starts to disappear.

621
00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.400
And if you walk through here, and I don't care if you're using daily, weekly, monthly,

622
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.820
but you'll see there's a tremendous amount of overlap.

623
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.300
As long as you know that and understand it,

624
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:09.120
it will start to help you adjust and build your strategies as well as your tactics.

625
00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.760
Okay. Short-term balance.

626
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.120
Again, I threw this term out before, and I love it.

627
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:22.180
Short-term balance is absolute paradise for short-term traders.

628
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.080
Because what are you doing?

629
00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:26.420
You're trying to trade the top to the bottom of the balance.

630
00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.980
So it's paradise there.

631
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.100
However, what happens to traders?

632
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.540
How many times do you hear me say,

633
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.480
traders do what works until what?

634
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.780
Until it doesn't work anymore.

635
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.240
So now, let's say a market's been in a four-day balance,

636
00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:47.300
and you've been pretty good at identifying the top and the bottom of that balance for the past four days.

637
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:54.260
Now, on day five, you break out from the top of the five-day balance.

638
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.420
Most traders are going to do what?

639
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.560
They're going to fade the breakout.

640
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.580
Because all of a sudden, they're going to see it.

641
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.700
They're going to see it.

642
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.960
Oh, another chance to fade or sell at the top of the balance.

643
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.840
So they sell it, and they're absolutely as wrong as wrong can be.

644
00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.180
Because the market has broken out to the upside.

645
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.560
As long as you understand that's the process,

646
00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.660
you can operate very successfully within that framework.

647
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:31.040
Now, here's something that I disagree with almost everybody that teaches about how to work and trade with markets.

648
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.440
People will tell you, and it always sounds so good,

649
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.140
they put their arm around you and they're really being your friend.

650
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.540
Let me tell you what you do.

651
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.160
You figure out what it is you do best,

652
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:44.600
and then you concentrate on what it is that you are the best at.

653
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.680
I don't believe that.

654
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.520
I think if you're going to be a professional trader,

655
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:56.060
you have got to learn to be able to adjust to what the market is doing.

656
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.820
You want to make a living out of this?

657
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.740
If it's a hobby, that's fine.

658
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.700
Go do what you think.

659
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.180
If you're talking about being a professional trader,

660
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.080
you have to be able to trade every kind of market.

661
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.000
You've got a market that's in a trading range,

662
00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.720
you become a trading, you trade the trading range.

663
00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.120
Trading ranges are going to be mostly regression to the mean type of trades.

664
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.200
Okay?

665
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.740
Market breaks out of the trading range,

666
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:24.200
then you've got to be a more aggressive trend type of trader

667
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.820
and go with the breakout.

668
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:31.800
You have to be able to trade what is going on in the market.

669
00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.280
So many times we get this thing down.

670
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.440
Well, I'm going to do this.

671
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.160
I'm going to do short-term trades,

672
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.400
and it works for a while,

673
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.900
and all of a sudden it just takes you out of the game,

674
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:42.360
and you don't understand.

675
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.740
People say, well, I'm really there.

676
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.560
I'm almost there, Jim.

677
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.880
You know, if I hadn't been for that one day.

678
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.740
Well, that one day was probably the day that you broke out of a range,

679
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.520
and it takes back multiple days.

680
00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.240
Not only do you lose financial capital,

681
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.860
but more importantly when that happens,

682
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.660
you lose something even more valuable,

683
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.540
and that's emotional capital.

684
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.780
When you lose emotional capital, you lose confidence.

685
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.780
When you lose confidence,

686
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.100
it is very difficult to trade and trade smartly.

687
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.040
You get behind emotionally.

688
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.160
You start thinking worst-case scenarios.

689
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.920
You start engaging in some behavior that is self-destruct.

690
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.960
We're in a period right now,

691
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.440
for those that are, you know,

692
00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.660
when you look at this video down the road,

693
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.780
you probably won't recall it,

694
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.520
but we're in a situation right now

695
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:31.860
where there's talk about some economic problems in Greece.

696
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.520
That has spread over to Portugal.

697
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.920
That has spread over to Spain.

698
00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.280
And now they're talking about contagion,

699
00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.040
and now this may affect the entire world.

700
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:48.420
With that, the dollar has become the vehicle of choice.

701
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.280
Right up here, we're looking at the dollar index,

702
00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.040
which I think is comprised of six different curves,

703
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.780
but it makes up, you know, that trading.

704
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.260
That's what we use to kind of measure it on the market.

705
00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.900
But the volatility is extreme.

706
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.980
It is not regression to the mean type of trading.

707
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.160
Trying to keep it on, you've got excess,

708
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.280
you've got excess, you've got gaps.

709
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.740
It's all over the lot.

710
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.880
If that's too volatile for you, stop.

711
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:16.140
But you cannot do dinky little regression

712
00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.160
to the mean trade in this type of environment.

713
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.080
It's also what I call background.

714
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.980
You have to, you ought to make a note

715
00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.280
of what is actually going on in the market.

716
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.020
Is the market trading on its own,

717
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.400
or is it being driven by other outside factors?

718
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:37.740
Many traders can't expand their imagination

719
00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.780
to move beyond the intuitive and misleading concept

720
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.260
that there is more risk to paying 12

721
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.280
than there is paying 10 for something.

722
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.640
Trading is, a lot of trading,

723
00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.860
is about creative problem solving.

724
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.560
Very important to be a creative problem solver.

725
00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.400
Be a creative problem solver,

726
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.900
you need to develop an imagination.

727
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.560
To enjoy imagination,

728
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.220
you have to let your mind open up and kind of wonder.

729
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.640
When you look today, if you start to study balance,

730
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.540
and you start your mind to expand,

731
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.240
you say, wait a minute,

732
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.480
if I broke into a new high in gold,

733
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.580
or in the crack spread,

734
00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.520
I could move gold, I could move $22.

735
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.580
Well, if your imagination only lets you see

736
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.640
three or four dollars, guess what?

737
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.160
You don't have a chance.

738
00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.160
There's an awful lot of imagination involved.

739
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.440
New discovery, new trends, new things.

740
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.740
They're covered and they're found out by imagination.

741
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.520
My biggest mistakes I ever make

742
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.920
is I get so focused on a market

743
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.720
because it's lulled me to sleep,

744
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.200
it's been in a, you know,

745
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.380
kind of a tight trading range for some period of time.

746
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.720
You just can't imagine that this market could break out

747
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.360
and just go like crazy.

748
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.620
And it happens all the time.

749
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.680
So it's a question of imagination.

750
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.760
You got a two-day balance.

751
00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.160
We come out of the two-day balance.

752
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.460
You want to be able to go with those trades,

753
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.740
monitor for continuation.

754
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.560
Sometimes you'll be surprised how big the move can be.

755
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.800
Okay, let's take a look at some more.

756
00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.820
This is the daily balance, mini S&P.

757
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.940
I just wanted to kind of walk through some examples in here.

758
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.300
What do I have down there?

759
00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.300
I have one, two, three, four, five, six,

760
00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.180
if I counted right, a seven, eight,

761
00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.940
looks like a nine-day balance.

762
00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.260
Then it breaks out of that balance, right?

763
00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.700
So the market comes up to here.

764
00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:44.080
We broke out of this balance right here.

765
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.700
We broke out of this balance.

766
00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.480
There's the breakout day.

767
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.140
We came up and balanced again.

768
00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.700
Notice this balance and this balance.

769
00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.700
We balanced again,

770
00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.840
and the market is moving higher.

771
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.940
Understanding coming out of balance

772
00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.260
is really the trend.

773
00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.960
You've got a trend underway.

774
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.680
So this is in the February and March period.

775
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.160
What is this right here?

776
00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:09.580
Excess.

777
00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:10.720
Excess, right?

778
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:11.720
That's excess.

779
00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.660
Excess marks what?

780
00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.080
The end of what?

781
00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.780
One auction.

782
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.340
The beginning of?

783
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.760
A new auction.

784
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.580
Where was this market going before we put the excess in?

785
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.240
It's going down, right?

786
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.400
Right there, it goes down.

787
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.540
It puts in the low.

788
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.500
We mark the end of one auction,

789
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.300
the beginning of another auction.

790
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.080
If I remember, this auction

791
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.860
was only a mere 600 points or so.

792
00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:38.820
Okay?

793
00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.780
Once it got under,

794
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.900
once it got underway.

795
00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.500
The two most important concepts

796
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.640
you'll ever deal with are?

797
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:46.560
Excess.

798
00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:46.680
Excess.

799
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.240
Excess.

800
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:49.440
And balance.

801
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.200
End of one auction,

802
00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.160
start of a new auction.

803
00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.020
Balance,

804
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.340
start of a new auction.

805
00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:55.600
Okay?

806
00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.580
Let's continue to walk through this.

807
00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:00.360
Monthly balance.

808
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.920
We get the same thing

809
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.560
in monthly balances.

810
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.960
So, here we are right here.

811
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:07.980
The market has been balancing

812
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.000
on a monthly basis.

813
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.920
There's an intermediate term excess high.

814
00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.740
Remember, this is a monthly.

815
00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.860
Intermediate term excess high.

816
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.300
From that high,

817
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.100
the market trades all the way back down, right?

818
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.440
Trades all the way back down,

819
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.420
almost to the other end of the extreme.

820
00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.800
And this would be called what?

821
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.080
If we looked up here and failed

822
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.440
on this intermediate auction,

823
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.180
and we auction all the way down here,

824
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.120
what would that be called

825
00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.680
on the bottom of that trading range?

826
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.580
Destination trade.

827
00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.500
It's a reference point.

828
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.460
But remember,

829
00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.940
once we look above something,

830
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.560
then I start thinking,

831
00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.080
and the term I use is destination trade.

832
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.680
I then start thinking the destination trade,

833
00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.480
if I fail at this end of balance,

834
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.900
the destination trade is down here

835
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.720
to the opposite end of balance.

836
00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.160
If I looked at,

837
00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.860
if I took out yesterday's high

838
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.740
and a daily thing,

839
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.100
and the market fails,

840
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.260
I would start thinking the possibility

841
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.700
that I could trade down to yesterday's low.

842
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.620
That would be my destination trade.

843
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.440
Does it mean it has to trade there?

844
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:11.940
No.

845
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.200
But at least it gives me a reference

846
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.680
to see how that auction is progressing.

847
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.200
So now, we come up.

848
00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.640
Remember, this is long-term.

849
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.140
We break above.

850
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.140
We come in here.

851
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:25.960
We break above.

852
00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.200
We take out this excess,

853
00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.020
and the market's off and running.

854
00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.380
And then you develop more long-term excess,

855
00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:36.740
and you start to work your way back down.

856
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.900
This is the monthly bar.

857
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.360
So this is actually not good.

858
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.080
It looks like it's not a very long time,

859
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.900
but remember, it's on a monthly basis.

860
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.000
Right down here,

861
00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.560
the market was right down here,

862
00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.820
and it was pressing.

863
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:52.700
These are the bonds.

864
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.940
It was pressing to go back.

865
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.600
We were trading over here.

866
00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.680
People were talking about taking out the low

867
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.420
going back to 2007.

868
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.600
We're down on the bottom.

869
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.220
You had the people coming on TV

870
00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.840
talking about bonds were really bad.

871
00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.100
The foreigners were going to stop buying our bonds.

872
00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.220
China, Japan.

873
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.620
They had the whole world scared to death.

874
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.660
That were going lower on the bonds.

875
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.820
In the paper the other day,

876
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.160
there was an article about,

877
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.620
oh, one of the,

878
00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:29.560
they were blaming Nisan Taleb,

879
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.440
the author, one of my favorite authors,

880
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.600
who wrote The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness.

881
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.440
Great, great writer that you ought to read multiple times.

882
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.880
They were blaming him for the market.

883
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:47.100
He put in a $7.5 million order to buy 50,000 option contracts.

884
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.200
So that was one of the culprits.

885
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:54.900
But Taleb writes about randomness in the market.

886
00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.440
Fooled by randomness, the black swan,

887
00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.920
and exogenous events causing these things.

888
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.240
And I always was amazed because

889
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.960
down at the bottom,

890
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.640
for a guy that believes in randomness,

891
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:11.080
he was on TV talking about how bad the bonds,

892
00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:12.740
what was going to happen to the bonds.

893
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:13.780
And guess what?

894
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.820
That may be right for a long-term basis.

895
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.260
But that's not where the bonds went.

896
00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.380
That's probably, what, about an $8,000 move?

897
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.540
I forget exactly what the low was.

898
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.840
If you take that reference point,

899
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.140
when this market on a long-term basis,

900
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.960
as much as they pressed on this,

901
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.060
as much as they pressed on this,

902
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.660
they didn't get it.

903
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:36.540
Okay?

904
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.820
First of all,

905
00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.140
how did you get down here,

906
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.280
down this low in the first place?

907
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.380
People were doing what?

908
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.260
Selling the market, right?

909
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.880
And we talked,

910
00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.360
we used the term earlier,

911
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.700
short in the hole.

912
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.060
Short in the hole means short at very bad prices.

913
00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.700
Now, generally,

914
00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.500
we think of being short in the hole

915
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.680
as happening to daytime frame traders.

916
00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:03.980
But you saw, we had,

917
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.400
we have scalpers,

918
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.660
we have daytime frame,

919
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.400
short time, intermediate, long term.

920
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:09.940
Guess what?

921
00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.920
It happens to all time frames.

922
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.300
When we got down here,

923
00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:18.780
I think it's pretty clear

924
00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:21.360
that we had the whole,

925
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.500
down in here, I'm sorry,

926
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.420
we had the whole world short.

927
00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.300
And when you,

928
00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:27.580
when you get down here,

929
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.600
and you can't go any further,

930
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.220
sometimes the market has to rally before what?

931
00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.320
Before it breaks.

932
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.620
One thing,

933
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.320
it's easier to understand in the daytime frame,

934
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.580
but if this is longer time frame,

935
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.700
watch out.

936
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:42.860
Incidentally,

937
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.260
those that get some of my written comments,

938
00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.340
what did I write the other day?

939
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.620
Picked up an article,

940
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.000
and it's a,

941
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:50.880
it's a publication,

942
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.120
it goes out to some hedge funds,

943
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.000
that the 10-year bond

944
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.560
was at historic low rates.

945
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.600
I'm sorry,

946
00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.920
the 10-year bond

947
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.440
was historic short interest.

948
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.280
The shortest the 10-year bond

949
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.240
had ever been recorded.

950
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.660
Right smack on the bottom of the market.

951
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:09.460
Guess what?

952
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.340
That's not daytime frame traders,

953
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:11.580
right?

954
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.920
Your long time frame traders

955
01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.000
were short at very bad prices

956
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.180
in the marketplace.

957
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.360
Now,

958
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.260
at the same time,

959
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.360
you really want to understand markets,

960
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.460
and somebody help me

961
01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.220
if I get the numbers wrong,

962
01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.960
but there was another article

963
01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.840
not too long ago,

964
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.300
and Goldman Sachs was looking for

965
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.480
three and a quarter on the 10-year,

966
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.420
three and a quarter yield

967
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.060
on the 10-year,

968
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.720
and Morgan Stanley was looking for what?

969
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.120
Five?

970
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.860
Five and a half.

971
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.460
Three and a quarter,

972
01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.580
five and a half yield.

973
01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.560
Two big trading firms,

974
01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.300
Goldman Sachs,

975
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:47.980
Morgan Stanley,

976
01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:48.660
three and a quarter,

977
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.720
five and a half.

978
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.880
That is absolutely a huge difference.

979
01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.940
Two of the biggest players in the world

980
01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.940
having totally different opinions

981
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.140
on where the bond market is going.

982
01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.040
And I say that,

983
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.100
and the importance is that,

984
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.280
is the reason that you want to get involved

985
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.600
in what I'm talking about

986
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.840
is you don't want to pick sides.

987
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.760
You don't want to have to pick sides

988
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.880
with Goldman or Morgan Stanley.

989
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.900
You want to be able to read the market

990
01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.780
on your own,

991
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.720
look at the market-generated information,

992
01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.540
understand the auction process,

993
01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.180
and trade the market accordingly.

994
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.280
We got down here,

995
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.080
and we didn't take out this low.

996
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.940
We got the whole world short.

997
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.020
And where's the market?

998
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:38.900
It's off and running.

999
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.440
It's hard for anybody to imagine

1000
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.520
the market could go that high.

1001
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.360
Now, people say,

1002
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:45.800
well, Jim,

1003
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.340
yeah, but that was only because

1004
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.280
of the flight to safety,

1005
01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.020
because of what was going on

1006
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.060
in Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Contagion.

1007
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.660
I say, yes,

1008
01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.380
that may have attributed to it,

1009
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.040
but guess what?

1010
01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.360
If the market conditions

1011
01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.180
weren't set up properly,

1012
01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.340
it wouldn't have got there.

1013
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.000
In other words,

1014
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.900
if the market wasn't too short,

1015
01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.760
you probably never would have gotten there.

1016
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.420
But once the market gets caught short,

1017
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.620
one short cover

1018
01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.440
begets another short cover,

1019
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.660
and then you have

1020
01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.400
price-based systems,

1021
01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.740
and you got these traders

1022
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.860
that have price-based systems

1023
01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.580
and hedge funds,

1024
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.020
and they start buying

1025
01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.420
based on their price-based systems,

1026
01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.740
hey, we're off and running.

1027
01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480
Does it make sense?

1028
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.600
Maybe not.

1029
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.860
Does it happen?

1030
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:30.780
Absolutely.

1031
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.440
There will be huge disconnects

1032
01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.420
continually between

1033
01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.200
what the economic reality is

1034
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.600
and what the market reality is.

1035
01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.980
The only reality,

1036
01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.500
if you're going to be a trader,

1037
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.540
that means anything to you

1038
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.740
is the market reality.

1039
01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.740
If you want to be an economist,

1040
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.840
get into another business.

1041
01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.400
We bury economists

1042
01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.680
in the trading world.

1043
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:57.440
You know,

1044
01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.380
this is trading.

1045
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:58.780
Remember,

1046
01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.680
I also said trading's a game.

1047
01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.720
When the traders know

1048
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.420
that they've got

1049
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.780
the long time frame

1050
01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.220
caught short,

1051
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:08.920
guess what the hedge funds

1052
01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.480
are going to do?

1053
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.180
They're going to squeeze them, right?

1054
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.380
They're going to,

1055
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.620
you hear people talk about,

1056
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.480
and somebody was sitting up

1057
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:15.920
in the front row,

1058
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:16.340
they said,

1059
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:16.660
well, Jim,

1060
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.580
aren't there market makers

1061
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.500
that take the other side

1062
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:18.980
of the trade?

1063
01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.460
You know,

1064
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.280
and half the people

1065
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.840
that have been around

1066
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.500
were trying to keep

1067
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.240
a straight face

1068
01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.540
in the room

1069
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.020
because these market makers,

1070
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.160
theoretically,

1071
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.540
if the market's going bid,

1072
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.100
they're not taking

1073
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:32.820
the other side.

1074
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.780
They're doing what?

1075
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.520
They're joining the bid.

1076
01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.260
They're going to squeeze it.

1077
01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.380
They're going to squeeze it

1078
01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.160
just as hard

1079
01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.820
as they can possibly squeeze it.

1080
01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.340
So you get these

1081
01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.700
tremendous moves

1082
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.180
in the market.

1083
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.240
They have nothing

1084
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.300
to do with reality,

1085
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.520
nothing to do

1086
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.240
with the fundamentals,

1087
01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:48.640
a lot,

1088
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.460
but it has to do

1089
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.920
with market-generated information.

1090
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.320
An auction is going to go

1091
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.120
until it's over, right?

1092
01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.480
You go to an auction,

1093
01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.580
it doesn't make any difference

1094
01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:58.540
how much work you've done

1095
01:03:58.540 --> 01:03:59.760
and how much you think

1096
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.460
something's worth

1097
01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.020
at the auction.

1098
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.360
If somebody's willing

1099
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.220
to pay more for it,

1100
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:03.640
guess what?

1101
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.100
That auction's going higher.

1102
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.920
Okay, let's go on.

1103
01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.060
We have a weekly balance

1104
01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.880
in bonds.

1105
01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.640
So when I look at my charts,

1106
01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.980
I look at the monthly balance,

1107
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.120
I look at the weekly balance,

1108
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.820
I mark the references

1109
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:19.980
for the highs and lows

1110
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.660
so I know where those levels are.

1111
01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:23.940
Let's take a look

1112
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:24.740
at the next slide.

1113
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:25.400
Okay?

1114
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.280
Now we have a spike.

1115
01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.420
So we have an excess spike in here,

1116
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.700
another form of reference.

1117
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.700
When I get the spike,

1118
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.360
what did I call it?

1119
01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.160
If the spike is to the downside,

1120
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.220
and we see that's pretty high,

1121
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.960
we got the spike,

1122
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.280
but it stayed pretty wide up there.

1123
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.560
So the market was already showing us

1124
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.820
some indication

1125
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.460
that it didn't want to go much lower.

1126
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.880
But we're looking at those things,

1127
01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.380
we're counting that as a reference.

1128
01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:06.880
1040.75 was the low for the year.

1129
01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.540
So even though we got the spike,

1130
01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.120
we got the spike down there,

1131
01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.560
we got to the low for the year,

1132
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.080
that reference worked,

1133
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.680
and the market started to move

1134
01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.520
off of that reference.

1135
01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.240
The break the last week,

1136
01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:26.020
if you look on a bar chart,

1137
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.000
you will see that

1138
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.300
when the market went down 1,000 points,

1139
01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:36.560
it went down to the excess low from February.

1140
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.960
And we talked about that earlier.

1141
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040
We got the excess low,

1142
01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:39.880
then it rallied,

1143
01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.380
the first rally out of it was 600 points.

1144
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.220
Before it was all done,

1145
01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.880
it was substantially larger than that.

1146
01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.680
But the market went down

1147
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.360
to a very identifiable break

1148
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.160
last week when it was down 1,000.

1149
01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.600
Now the question is,

1150
01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.160
you know,

1151
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.040
were you fast enough?

1152
01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.800
I didn't have an imagination

1153
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.920
that told me we could go down to that reference.

1154
01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.840
I pride myself on imagination

1155
01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.940
that wasn't one of them

1156
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.680
that worked very well.

1157
01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:01.320
Okay,

1158
01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.040
let's continue to move on.

1159
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.780
Long-term balance and excess.

1160
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.060
In here,

1161
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.520
we've looked at this before,

1162
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.640
or something similar.

1163
01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.380
Our excess low,

1164
01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.700
the market's been going this way,

1165
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.140
excess marks the end of one auction,

1166
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.320
the beginning of the next auction.

1167
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.520
Then,

1168
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.280
the market starts to rally higher.

1169
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.560
One of the things

1170
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.240
that we do

1171
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.360
to judge the age of a trend,

1172
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.580
most people get trapped

1173
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.340
by judging the age of a trend

1174
01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.540
by their intuitive feeling

1175
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.680
that price is too high

1176
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.760
or too low or whatever.

1177
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:42.700
Okay?

1178
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.180
There's the excess.

1179
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.440
Excess starts a new auction, right?

1180
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.740
Excess goes up,

1181
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.320
and what do I have right here?

1182
01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.080
I have a balance.

1183
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:53.260
So,

1184
01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.120
a balance for one,

1185
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:54.360
two,

1186
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:54.700
three,

1187
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:54.980
four,

1188
01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.300
five,

1189
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:55.540
six,

1190
01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:55.760
seven,

1191
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.800
eight days.

1192
01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.040
Then,

1193
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.220
what do I have here?

1194
01:06:59.280 --> 01:06:59.820
It does.

1195
01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.800
It breaks out of this,

1196
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.420
and I balance again.

1197
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:03.380
Okay?

1198
01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.740
The balance,

1199
01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.240
there's a balance.

1200
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:07.760
If I,

1201
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:07.960
well,

1202
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:08.580
right down there,

1203
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.880
we'll call this the first balance.

1204
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:10.180
No,

1205
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:10.380
we can,

1206
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.140
this is actually a balance right in here.

1207
01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.100
Once it re-entered this,

1208
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.180
the destination trade

1209
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.260
becomes up here someplace,

1210
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.480
then I got a balance,

1211
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.820
a balance again.

1212
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.740
When we have balances,

1213
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.560
doesn't work perfectly,

1214
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.820
but the distance between

1215
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.480
one balance

1216
01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.020
to another balance

1217
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.960
is an indication

1218
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.160
of the age

1219
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.980
of the trend.

1220
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.600
If you take the high

1221
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.540
of one balance

1222
01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.160
and the low

1223
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.240
of the next balance,

1224
01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.100
and you can put your pencil

1225
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.420
or a finger between it,

1226
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.540
the option

1227
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.300
is relatively low.

1228
01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.580
when the next balance area

1229
01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.420
sits on top of

1230
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:50.580
or back within

1231
01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.760
the previous balance area,

1232
01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.580
doesn't mean the auction's over.

1233
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.360
It means it's aging.

1234
01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920
We break out of here.

1235
01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:58.680
We do get a little

1236
01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.480
three-day balance,

1237
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.920
but coming out of here,

1238
01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.360
the next balance

1239
01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.340
is considerably higher.

1240
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:05.620
So what that's,

1241
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.740
this from here,

1242
01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.180
from the excess up to here,

1243
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.220
to here,

1244
01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.640
it's telling me

1245
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.620
that the auction

1246
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.480
is still relatively what?

1247
01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.260
Still relatively young.

1248
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.080
Now,

1249
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.020
that may contrast,

1250
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.900
contrast tremendously

1251
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.160
with what your intuitive feelings

1252
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:23.860
are telling you.

1253
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.280
It may contrast

1254
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.260
with what you hear

1255
01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.020
on the news,

1256
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.560
but if you sit there

1257
01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.500
and do your own work,

1258
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.080
even looking right here,

1259
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:31.800
coming down,

1260
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.100
the balance between

1261
01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:33.880
here and here,

1262
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.360
the market's got

1263
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.240
a lot longer to,

1264
01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.240
it's a pretty good move.

1265
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.860
That's 11.40,

1266
01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.980
finally moves down here

1267
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.720
to about,

1268
01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.320
what is that,

1269
01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.680
10.40,

1270
01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.020
about another 100 handles.

1271
01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.140
Balance,

1272
01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.580
break below it,

1273
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:50.560
balance,

1274
01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:51.520
you can drive

1275
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.300
two dreams of a car

1276
01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.060
and a truck through here,

1277
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:53.280
right?

1278
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.320
Balance,

1279
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.220
it's still fairly young.

1280
01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.600
We've distanced,

1281
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.800
this isn't quite as much,

1282
01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.420
but notice,

1283
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840
we never really balance.

1284
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.580
We've got the excess

1285
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.140
and now we're back up

1286
01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:03.460
into here.

1287
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:03.660
So,

1288
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.940
if you took the next balance

1289
01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.660
right here,

1290
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.300
you see how it's kind of

1291
01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.120
back into that balance?

1292
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.600
You get the feeling

1293
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.580
that you've got excess

1294
01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.240
on the bottom.

1295
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:13.720
You didn't,

1296
01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.520
your next balance,

1297
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.820
if I took it right through here,

1298
01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.840
your next balance is

1299
01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.500
back really into this.

1300
01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.060
So,

1301
01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.000
you're getting aged,

1302
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:20.820
you're getting older.

1303
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:21.660
Now,

1304
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.540
you're really starting

1305
01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.700
to accelerate up there.

1306
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.600
It's a younger auction.

1307
01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:26.860
Again,

1308
01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.240
much more reliable

1309
01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.140
than thinking

1310
01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.260
what you feel intuitive

1311
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.300
or what you read

1312
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.520
or anything else.

1313
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.320
Non-linear breaks.

1314
01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.420
You'll hear me talk

1315
01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.200
a lot about

1316
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.400
coming out of balance.

1317
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:40.960
You get a non-linear break.

1318
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.580
These are the,

1319
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.260
these are good profit potentials.

1320
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.680
They are also killers

1321
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.360
if you are the wrong way

1322
01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.300
in a market.

1323
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:51.120
A non-linear break

1324
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.360
is nothing more

1325
01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.180
than a very rapid

1326
01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.520
reordering

1327
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.980
of the thinking

1328
01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.140
in a marketplace.

1329
01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.520
People resist change forever.

1330
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.320
How many name,

1331
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.320
know the name,

1332
01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.640
Kuhn?

1333
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.380
K-U-K-U-H.

1334
01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.460
Kuhn was a scientist

1335
01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.060
born in,

1336
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:10.880
I think,

1337
01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.060
1922.

1338
01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.080
And one of the words

1339
01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.240
that he made famous

1340
01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.700
was paradigm shift.

1341
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.880
Paradigm shift just,

1342
01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.360
it just simply means

1343
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.900
a reorder of thinking.

1344
01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.680
But when Kuhn goes through

1345
01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.060
his whole explanation,

1346
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.820
people fight change drastically.

1347
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.700
They don't like change.

1348
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.700
So they put it off

1349
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.200
until there's so many anomalies

1350
01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.780
that they can no longer

1351
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.800
deny that change is occurring.

1352
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.280
When they get to that realization,

1353
01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.000
that is when you get

1354
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.640
a non-linear break

1355
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.180
in the market

1356
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.020
or you get a whole

1357
01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.620
reorder of thinking.

1358
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:49.340
Now,

1359
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.420
when Kuhn was talking about,

1360
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:52.140
you know,

1361
01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.180
paradigm shifts

1362
01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:54.640
and all this,

1363
01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:55.560
he was talking

1364
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.940
something much bigger

1365
01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.700
than we're talking.

1366
01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.220
But I find

1367
01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.640
the same type of thing

1368
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.320
occurs

1369
01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.340
in all time frames.

1370
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.140
Whether it's day time frame,

1371
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.040
they're dying like this,

1372
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040
and everybody's got

1373
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.080
their narrow little view,

1374
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.320
and all of a sudden

1375
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.120
enough anomalies

1376
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:11.780
take place,

1377
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:12.980
and they realize

1378
01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:13.580
they're wrong,

1379
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.000
and you get this huge

1380
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:15.920
rapid move

1381
01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.080
out of one distribution

1382
01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:17.880
to another.

1383
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.880
The same thing happens

1384
01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.640
with the longer

1385
01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.880
the time frame you go,

1386
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.240
it happens with

1387
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.160
all the way along.

1388
01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.180
And I think this is

1389
01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.760
not what Kuhn intended,

1390
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:28.680
but I think it's

1391
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.360
very similar.

1392
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.840
And these non-linear breaks

1393
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.760
are,

1394
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.440
so we get a non-linear break,

1395
01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.840
we get a paradigm shift,

1396
01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.660
now we go to a new model,

1397
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.700
a new way of thinking,

1398
01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.820
a new status quo,

1399
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.200
and now we go back

1400
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:40.740
and we go into

1401
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.660
range-bound trading

1402
01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.960
for a period of time.

1403
01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.820
Paradise for shorter-term trading.

1404
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.460
I think this process

1405
01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.300
happens continually.

1406
01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.580
Even here,

1407
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.700
on this multi-day balance

1408
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.140
right here,

1409
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.220
what did we get right here?

1410
01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.680
We got to,

1411
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.320
we look,

1412
01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:57.340
now there's a case,

1413
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.960
we look below the balance,

1414
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.140
did we fail

1415
01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:00.980
or were we successful?

1416
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.280
We failed,

1417
01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.740
look below the balance,

1418
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:05.540
it failed,

1419
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:06.880
the bidders were there,

1420
01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:07.680
the market was bad,

1421
01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.440
and then,

1422
01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.740
once you re-enter this,

1423
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080
the destination trade

1424
01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:11.660
becomes what?

1425
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.820
The other end,

1426
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.840
the destination trade

1427
01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.520
comes up here.

1428
01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:16.580
Anyhow,

1429
01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.460
there's all kind

1430
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.840
of information in here.

1431
01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.300
It's a lot harder

1432
01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:20.900
when you're in front

1433
01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.360
of a machine

1434
01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.200
and price-in-moving

1435
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.060
than it is when

1436
01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:23.640
you're sitting with,

1437
01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.380
somebody's got

1438
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.500
pre-prepared slides.

1439
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.260
Okay,

1440
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640
let's go on

1441
01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.560
and see what we've got up.

1442
01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.240
Gaps.

1443
01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.140
Gaps are also

1444
01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.020
a form of excess.

1445
01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.620
Gaps are also

1446
01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.920
a form of non-linear movement.

1447
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.140
Gaps also perform

1448
01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.240
very similar

1449
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.200
to Kuhn's philosophy

1450
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.760
of a paradigm shift,

1451
01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.500
a reorder of thinking.

1452
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.460
When a market gap's

1453
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.120
higher or lower,

1454
01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.700
at least from last night

1455
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.400
to this morning,

1456
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.020
there's a total reorder

1457
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:53.780
of thinking

1458
01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:55.540
about what is

1459
01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.840
the correct price

1460
01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.580
or value.

1461
01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.640
Gaps are extremely important.

1462
01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:00.060
Now,

1463
01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.620
for those that have

1464
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.420
done a lot of work

1465
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.680
in traditional market

1466
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.020
and thinking,

1467
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.340
you will think of a gap

1468
01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.640
as the difference

1469
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.820
between last night's

1470
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.120
close or settle

1471
01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.220
and today's opening.

1472
01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.060
That is not the gap

1473
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:15.860
I'm talking about.

1474
01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.000
I pay no attention to that.

1475
01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.220
The gap I'm talking about

1476
01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.160
is outside of yesterday's,

1477
01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:22.960
totally outside

1478
01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.000
of yesterday's range.

1479
01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.660
It has nothing to do

1480
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.700
with last night's settle.

1481
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.040
It's outside

1482
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:28.980
of yesterday's range.

1483
01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.100
So a gap has to go,

1484
01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:30.900
if it's a gap

1485
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.600
to the downside,

1486
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.520
it has to go below

1487
01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.980
and stay below

1488
01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.400
yesterday's range.

1489
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.300
That is a gap

1490
01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.140
to the downside

1491
01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:39.820
the way I look at it.

1492
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.260
Am I out of balance?

1493
01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:42.880
I'm out of balance.

1494
01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:43.660
I'm out of balance

1495
01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.620
to a pretty good degree.

1496
01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:46.580
Okay?

1497
01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:47.980
Let's take a look

1498
01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.540
at what we've got

1499
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.300
coming up next.

1500
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.860
Excess occurs

1501
01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.980
in all time frames.

1502
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.180
You've heard this before.

1503
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.100
Marks the end of one auction,

1504
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.560
beginning of another auction.

1505
01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.420
Is it applicable

1506
01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:00.560
to the day time frame?

1507
01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:01.860
It is.

1508
01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.100
I use 30 minute,

1509
01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.920
I use 30 minute increments

1510
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.240
to construct my profiles.

1511
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.380
I don't care

1512
01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.440
if you use 15 minutes,

1513
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:09.960
one hour.

1514
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.080
The principles

1515
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.320
are the same

1516
01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320
in all time frames.

1517
01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:15.660
The principles

1518
01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.600
ought to be

1519
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.800
exactly the same

1520
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.600
in all markets

1521
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.520
that are financial

1522
01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.240
in nature.

1523
01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.540
Now,

1524
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:23.980
I used to do this

1525
01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.720
for real estate.

1526
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:25.900
I sold a home,

1527
01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:26.920
I lived north of Chicago,

1528
01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:27.760
I sold a home,

1529
01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.300
I did the same thing.

1530
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:29.540
Now,

1531
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.240
they may have to advertise

1532
01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.160
a little longer

1533
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:32.880
in real estate,

1534
01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.520
but the principles

1535
01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.500
ought to be the same,

1536
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.240
whether it's a bank

1537
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.080
allocating credit,

1538
01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.020
real estate,

1539
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:38.980
financial markets,

1540
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.080
the only change

1541
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.580
will be

1542
01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.020
things in the

1543
01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.040
stock and futures market

1544
01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.120
happen far more rapidly.

1545
01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.160
But the basic

1546
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:47.920
three principles

1547
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.040
are

1548
01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:49.680
time,

1549
01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.200
price,

1550
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:50.800
and volume.

1551
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.080
Price does what?

1552
01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.240
Advertises what?

1553
01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.160
Opportunity.

1554
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.600
What regulates

1555
01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.280
all advertised

1556
01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:57.860
opportunity?

1557
01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.160
It's time,

1558
01:14:59.260 --> 01:14:59.460
right?

1559
01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.140
And volume

1560
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:02.460
measures the success

1561
01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.080
or failure

1562
01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.840
of all advertised

1563
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.620
opportunities.

1564
01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.860
Three basic

1565
01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.100
economic principles

1566
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.060
applicable to

1567
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:10.960
all markets

1568
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.040
that are financial

1569
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.680
in nature.

1570
01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:13.580
Okay?

1571
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.540
What do we do?

1572
01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.300
That's part of

1573
01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.320
the auction process.

1574
01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.980
We use the market

1575
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.860
profile to record

1576
01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:22.300
the auction process

1577
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.780
and the dynamics

1578
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.980
of what is going on.

1579
01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:26.140
What is different

1580
01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:26.780
in our market

1581
01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.780
is we continue

1582
01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.220
to auction

1583
01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.120
from high to low

1584
01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.180
and low to high

1585
01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:30.920
because it's a

1586
01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.440
continuous

1587
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.900
two-way auction

1588
01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.140
process.

1589
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:35.740
Excess

1590
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.680
starts the trade

1591
01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.820
location process

1592
01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.480
all over.

1593
01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.280
We haven't talked

1594
01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:41.760
about it

1595
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.160
yesterday,

1596
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:42.240
today.

1597
01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.900
But let's go back

1598
01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:46.980
and think about

1599
01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.180
a 10-day,

1600
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:48.840
we looked at some

1601
01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.320
charts that had

1602
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.500
like a 10-day

1603
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:50.940
balance.

1604
01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:53.260
Let me talk

1605
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:53.880
about trade

1606
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.000
location for a

1607
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.240
second.

1608
01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.460
If I am at

1609
01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.840
the bottom

1610
01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.140
or top extreme

1611
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.860
of a 10-day

1612
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:03.460
balance,

1613
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.360
does it take me

1614
01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.260
very long

1615
01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:06.880
to know if I'm

1616
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.400
right or wrong?

1617
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.040
If I buy at

1618
01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:10.420
the bottom

1619
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.200
and I get outside,

1620
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:11.700
I know pretty

1621
01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:12.420
quickly I'm wrong,

1622
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.600
I sell at the top,

1623
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.100
I know pretty

1624
01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.160
quickly if I'm

1625
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.640
right or wrong.

1626
01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.100
If I get

1627
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.020
emotionally involved

1628
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:18.840
and I buy right

1629
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.340
in the middle

1630
01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:19.940
of a 10-day

1631
01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:20.380
balance,

1632
01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.300
how far does

1633
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:22.880
that market

1634
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.980
have to auction

1635
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.400
before I get

1636
01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.340
confirmation that

1637
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:27.780
I'm right or

1638
01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.000
wrong?

1639
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.840
It's got to go

1640
01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.520
to one extreme

1641
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:30.960
or the other,

1642
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:31.200
right?

1643
01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.480
So now,

1644
01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.360
let's talk

1645
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.180
about risk.

1646
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.860
Risk is a word

1647
01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.380
that everybody

1648
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.220
throws around,

1649
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.640
but I don't

1650
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.440
think many people

1651
01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.800
understand risk.

1652
01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.600
Risk is a point,

1653
01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.300
to me,

1654
01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:45.220
risk is a point

1655
01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:46.860
that where I know

1656
01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:47.880
I'm wrong in a trade.

1657
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.160
So,

1658
01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.740
if I look at

1659
01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:51.820
a 10-day balance,

1660
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.080
one of the things

1661
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:53.900
I do and I say,

1662
01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:54.180
okay,

1663
01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.540
the bottom of that

1664
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.620
range is my lowest

1665
01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.400
trade location,

1666
01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.760
I go up a quarter,

1667
01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:00.600
I go up a half,

1668
01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.480
three quarters at the top,

1669
01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.320
I can calibrate,

1670
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.140
I can calibrate

1671
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.700
from a trade location

1672
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.280
standpoint,

1673
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.060
where I am entering

1674
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.340
into or exiting

1675
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.040
my trade.

1676
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.240
Trade location

1677
01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.020
is one of the

1678
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:16.900
best risk qualifiers

1679
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.980
you'll ever run

1680
01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:18.400
across.

1681
01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:19.480
Remember,

1682
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.560
if I buy or sell

1683
01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:20.940
in the middle

1684
01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.920
of a 10-day balance,

1685
01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.720
I've got to move

1686
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.860
an awful long way

1687
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.160
before I really know

1688
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.380
if I'm right or wrong.

1689
01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.920
If I concentrate

1690
01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.400
on trade location,

1691
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.640
I can reduce my risk,

1692
01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.120
I can know much quicker

1693
01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.080
if I'm right or wrong,

1694
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:35.940
and also,

1695
01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:36.600
if I'm right,

1696
01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.540
I've got a much

1697
01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.400
bigger opportunity.

1698
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.460
Trade location

1699
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.760
is one of the

1700
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.140
best risk qualifiers

1701
01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.280
you will ever run

1702
01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:44.680
across.

1703
01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:45.980
And when you get

1704
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.360
excess,

1705
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.940
excess marks

1706
01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:48.680
the end of what?

1707
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.300
One auction

1708
01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.460
and the beginning

1709
01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:52.320
of a new auction,

1710
01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:52.580
right?

1711
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:53.320
So,

1712
01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.640
excess also starts

1713
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.100
the trade location

1714
01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.100
process all over again.

1715
01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:00.340
So,

1716
01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.120
if I buy right

1717
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:01.720
on the excess

1718
01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:02.480
or a couple ticks

1719
01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:02.920
above it,

1720
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:03.900
it doesn't take me

1721
01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.420
long to know

1722
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:04.860
I'm wrong.

1723
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.320
the higher

1724
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.320
I get away from it,

1725
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:08.860
the greater the risk

1726
01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:09.520
that I have,

1727
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.120
or theoretically.

1728
01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:10.740
So,

1729
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.200
I'm only using that

1730
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:12.800
in one aspect.

1731
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.800
I'm using it

1732
01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.400
to identify

1733
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.580
trade location.

1734
01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.400
I'm using trade location

1735
01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.240
as one element

1736
01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.400
to identify

1737
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.120
what is my risk,

1738
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:22.840
how much risk

1739
01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.400
am I employing.

1740
01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:25.540
Okay.

1741
01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.260
Again,

1742
01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.060
we say here,

1743
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.900
it's very difficult

1744
01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.060
to execute

1745
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.480
unless you have prepared.

1746
01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.000
if you've got

1747
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.680
a market coming down

1748
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.500
and it's coming down

1749
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.540
on lower volume,

1750
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.840
poor structure,

1751
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.300
and I'm finally

1752
01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.000
getting excess.

1753
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:43.980
If I see the market

1754
01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.680
coming down,

1755
01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:45.900
lower volume,

1756
01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:46.760
poor structure,

1757
01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.560
while I do my homework

1758
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.280
and preparation

1759
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:49.740
at night,

1760
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.480
I may start to prepare

1761
01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.680
and looking for

1762
01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.520
a buying opportunity.

1763
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.260
I'm saying,

1764
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:54.520
okay,

1765
01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.640
I don't think

1766
01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.600
it's completed yet.

1767
01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.180
I don't think

1768
01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.080
the auction process

1769
01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.840
is completed.

1770
01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.780
But I'm prepared

1771
01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:01.860
and I'm looking

1772
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:02.820
for an opportunity.

1773
01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:03.860
Now,

1774
01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.600
I get an excess low.

1775
01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.620
I'm already prepared.

1776
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.500
I've already mentally

1777
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.340
conditioned myself.

1778
01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.080
Now,

1779
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.380
my ability to execute

1780
01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.180
on that trade

1781
01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.560
is far greater.

1782
01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.740
Then all of a sudden,

1783
01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.260
I'm the guy

1784
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.440
that came off the floor.

1785
01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:17.300
I hung my coat up.

1786
01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.040
I went and had a beer.

1787
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.000
I came in the next morning,

1788
01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.180
put my trade on.

1789
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.280
The market starts to trade.

1790
01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:21.620
I said,

1791
01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:22.220
oh,

1792
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:22.860
what am I going to do

1793
01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.220
the day?

1794
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.980
There is no preparation.

1795
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.660
When you get to

1796
01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:27.700
that great opportunity,

1797
01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.000
you probably won't

1798
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:29.700
recognize it.

1799
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.340
You won't be prepared

1800
01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.740
to take advantage of it.

1801
01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:33.300
So,

1802
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.800
as you do your preparation,

1803
01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:35.860
your scenarios,

1804
01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:36.840
you may say

1805
01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840
the last couple of days

1806
01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.740
have been really poor

1807
01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:39.780
coming down volume,

1808
01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.360
structure,

1809
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.560
everything else.

1810
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:41.760
You say,

1811
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:42.900
it doesn't look completed.

1812
01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:44.540
But if I get any kind

1813
01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.260
of excess low

1814
01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.300
or good trade location,

1815
01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.000
I may look for a place

1816
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:48.560
to go long.

1817
01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.120
I've done some preparation.

1818
01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.540
I have some idea

1819
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.820
what I want to do.

1820
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.220
I have some kind

1821
01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:55.680
strategic thinking.

1822
01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.160
I have some idea

1823
01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.180
of how tactically

1824
01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.320
I may want

1825
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.600
to get into that trade.

1826
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.160
I am prepared.

1827
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.520
I will compete

1828
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.040
against you

1829
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:05.700
when I'm prepared.

1830
01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:06.740
When I'm not prepared,

1831
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:07.560
it's going to be

1832
01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.260
much harder

1833
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.900
because when price

1834
01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.640
is moving around,

1835
01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.880
it's really hard

1836
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.200
to think on the fly.

1837
01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.620
It's really hard.

1838
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.260
And the more emotion,

1839
01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.240
the more emotion

1840
01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:17.700
you're under,

1841
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.260
the more unprepared

1842
01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:19.780
you are,

1843
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.080
the more you start

1844
01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.460
thinking worst case scenario,

1845
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.460
the more you start

1846
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.540
thinking worst case scenario,

1847
01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.200
the narrower your

1848
01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.240
thought process gets,

1849
01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.920
the greater the opportunity

1850
01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.440
that you're going

1851
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.400
to do exactly

1852
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.140
what you shouldn't do.

1853
01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:32.320
Okay?

1854
01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.460
Let's continue

1855
01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.060
and look here.

1856
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:34.300
Now,

1857
01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.240
trade location

1858
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.120
is the best tool

1859
01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.740
available for risk control.

1860
01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.160
Same thing

1861
01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.420
we've just talked about.

1862
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:41.660
Review.

1863
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.260
Excess starts

1864
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.640
the trade location process

1865
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.460
all over again.

1866
01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.580
you can just kind of see

1867
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.020
from here

1868
01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.160
back up to the top.

1869
01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.460
Look it up here.

1870
01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.200
Right there.

1871
01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.160
There's a little balance.

1872
01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.720
What's this trade location

1873
01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:57.140
up here?

1874
01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.540
Almost at the top,

1875
01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:58.780
right?

1876
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.200
Then we've got

1877
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.840
trade location

1878
01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.480
and right here

1879
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.020
is a little excess.

1880
01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:04.100
And what do we have

1881
01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:04.640
right here?

1882
01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.840
A little bit of balance,

1883
01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.100
right?

1884
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:07.980
Bang!

1885
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:08.980
We come out of balance.

1886
01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:10.440
What do you think

1887
01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.460
your imagination

1888
01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.920
can handle this?

1889
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.040
Unless you're prepared.

1890
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.140
But if I sit there

1891
01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.260
and say the trade location

1892
01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:18.840
is here.

1893
01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:20.580
The trade location here.

1894
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.440
Balance is here.

1895
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.920
And you don't know

1896
01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.980
it's going to be this big.

1897
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.660
But what you do want to do

1898
01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:26.760
is be prepared.

1899
01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.160
Coming out of balance,

1900
01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:29.480
you want to be prepared

1901
01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.680
to go with that trade.

1902
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.480
It is going to be

1903
01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.380
much harder to do

1904
01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.780
because the breakout

1905
01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.760
is going to be down

1906
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.560
in here someplace.

1907
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.300
So the market's already

1908
01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.000
going to be down

1909
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:39.560
for the day.

1910
01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.300
And if you don't understand

1911
01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:41.940
it's a breakout

1912
01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:42.720
from balance,

1913
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:43.840
it's going to be really hard

1914
01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.260
for you to go

1915
01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:44.860
with that trade.

1916
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.180
If you understand

1917
01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.380
trade location

1918
01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.100
from the top,

1919
01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.060
you understand the balance,

1920
01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:49.880
you come out of balance,

1921
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.300
you understand the destination

1922
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.520
trade is sometime,

1923
01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:53.480
someplace down

1924
01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.120
in the lower end.

1925
01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.600
If you understand that,

1926
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.780
all of a sudden,

1927
01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.140
your world starts

1928
01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.680
to move in slow motion.

1929
01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.440
You start to see

1930
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.460
the trade developing.

1931
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:03.340
You know,

1932
01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.260
it's like a pass.

1933
01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.220
I'm in Chicago,

1934
01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.620
just like Michael Jordan

1935
01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:07.760
passing behind his back,

1936
01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.780
looking off to the right.

1937
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:09.700
And you say,

1938
01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.640
how did number 23

1939
01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.360
ever do that?

1940
01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:12.600
Okay?

1941
01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:13.820
Prepared.

1942
01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.480
It's worked for

1943
01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.540
a long period of time.

1944
01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.480
The name of this video

1945
01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:17.940
we're doing

1946
01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:18.400
is called

1947
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.580
Field of Vision.

1948
01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.280
Field of Vision,

1949
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.420
you get up there,

1950
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.000
you're looking at

1951
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.640
a lot of things.

1952
01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:25.500
Your field of vision,

1953
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.540
it's taking in the high,

1954
01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:27.720
it's taking in the low,

1955
01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.100
it's taking in the balance,

1956
01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.280
it's taking in the excess.

1957
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.580
Let me share with you

1958
01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.240
for a second

1959
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.880
how we came up

1960
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.160
with that name.

1961
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.440
I'm talking with

1962
01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.220
Julia one day

1963
01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.360
and Julia was a star

1964
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.320
field hockey player

1965
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.160
at UMass.

1966
01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.360
And we were just

1967
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.580
talking about trading

1968
01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.580
and the emotions

1969
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.200
and all the pieces

1970
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.060
that are involved

1971
01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.180
and I said,

1972
01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.820
tell me about

1973
01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.780
the really good players

1974
01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.180
at UMass.

1975
01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.200
And she said,

1976
01:22:59.280 --> 01:22:59.420
well,

1977
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.220
the best player

1978
01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.180
we had was Megan.

1979
01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:02.740
Megan went to

1980
01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.420
the Olympics twice?

1981
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:04.940
Three times.

1982
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.020
Megan went to the Olympics

1983
01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:06.660
three times.

1984
01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.460
She works for

1985
01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.380
State Street Bank

1986
01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.840
and Trust today

1987
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.020
and Julia said,

1988
01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.520
it was hard to believe

1989
01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.300
how calm she was.

1990
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.220
How calm she was

1991
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.620
and saw everything

1992
01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.660
that was going on

1993
01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:20.160
in the field.

1994
01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.240
And she said,

1995
01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.220
she never made

1996
01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.220
an angle shot

1997
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.380
at the goal.

1998
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:26.500
Well, I mean,

1999
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.340
I wouldn't have known that

2000
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:27.620
but I said,

2001
01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:28.420
well, an angle shot,

2002
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.260
an angle shot,

2003
01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:29.660
guess what?

2004
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:30.520
I said,

2005
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.220
I can see you got

2006
01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.100
more time to see it,

2007
01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:32.680
you got more time

2008
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.120
to cut it off.

2009
01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.240
She said her shot,

2010
01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.140
when she made her shot,

2011
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.280
it was always straight,

2012
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:36.800
hard,

2013
01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.340
and right at the goal.

2014
01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.120
Kind of a direct shot.

2015
01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.100
And then,

2016
01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:42.560
out of her mouth came,

2017
01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.420
she had a great

2018
01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.280
field of vision.

2019
01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:46.780
And I just said,

2020
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:47.740
thank you very much.

2021
01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.620
I think we have the name

2022
01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.700
of our trading video.

2023
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.500
Because it just

2024
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:54.800
made sense

2025
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.740
that that is what

2026
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.680
we're talking about.

2027
01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.380
And then I quiz

2028
01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:00.600
Julia Moore

2029
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.900
about some of the other players.

2030
01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:02.600
Yeah,

2031
01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:03.120
she said there were

2032
01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:03.620
other players

2033
01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.540
that were more emotional,

2034
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.760
their shots were more erratic,

2035
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.960
more anxious

2036
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.940
to take the shots,

2037
01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.480
not as much field of vision,

2038
01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.840
not as much patience.

2039
01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:14.800
But she said,

2040
01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.440
you looked at Megan,

2041
01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.760
you really never knew

2042
01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.440
that she had

2043
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.860
the whole field of vision

2044
01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:19.520
in mind.

2045
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.540
And it's just one

2046
01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:22.020
of those things

2047
01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:22.760
when that came out

2048
01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.140
of her mouth,

2049
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.020
I just knew

2050
01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:24.900
that was what it is.

2051
01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:25.860
And as we thought

2052
01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:26.640
about it for the next

2053
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.460
two or three days,

2054
01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.560
we said that's got

2055
01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.300
to be what it is.

2056
01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.500
But that's what it's about.

2057
01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.200
And isn't this,

2058
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.460
you're taking in

2059
01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.080
to do these really good trades

2060
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.240
and that's a great opportunity.

2061
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.100
You have to have

2062
01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.580
the field of vision

2063
01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.220
in mind.

2064
01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.600
You can't make,

2065
01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.460
you start making

2066
01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.600
a few erratic shots

2067
01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.540
or one of the other

2068
01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.380
thing that goes on,

2069
01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.380
you get this great

2070
01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.420
opportunity is coming up

2071
01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:48.740
and you're making

2072
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.060
some little insignificant trade.

2073
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:52.940
You get into

2074
01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.400
some little insignificant trade.

2075
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.800
It's the wrong direction.

2076
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.060
And what's the problem

2077
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:58.940
with a bad trade?

2078
01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.360
Problem with a bad trade,

2079
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:00.940
it keeps you out

2080
01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:01.580
of a good trade.

2081
01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.320
And we've all been there.

2082
01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:04.700
We sit in front

2083
01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.400
of our machines.

2084
01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.120
We think we're paying

2085
01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:06.920
for the quote equipment

2086
01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.640
and everything else.

2087
01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:08.840
We end up doing

2088
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.460
some trade

2089
01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.120
that was meaningless

2090
01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.720
and we miss

2091
01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.080
the really big opportunities.

2092
01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.480
We close down.

2093
01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.660
We miss the field,

2094
01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.160
the field of vision in there.

2095
01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.500
Now what happens?

2096
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.000
We go all the way down

2097
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:21.800
to the lower.

2098
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:22.480
We looked at part

2099
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.080
of this before.

2100
01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.240
We go all the way down

2101
01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.580
to this extreme.

2102
01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.660
Then what happens?

2103
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.180
We fail.

2104
01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.440
We don't carry through.

2105
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:31.420
Okay.

2106
01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:32.500
Where's the next,

2107
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.680
where's the next auction going?

2108
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.620
We saw it on a

2109
01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:35.720
daytime frame basis.

2110
01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:37.020
It happens in all

2111
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:37.620
time frames.

2112
01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040
So then what did

2113
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:39.540
the market do?

2114
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.540
It started going back

2115
01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.700
the other way.

2116
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:42.800
Okay.

2117
01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.220
So it's all

2118
01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:45.040
within the field.

2119
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.680
Destination trade,

2120
01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.420
I threw it out.

2121
01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.220
This is the first time

2122
01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:48.660
I've seen,

2123
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.860
I think you've seen it

2124
01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:50.320
in print.

2125
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.760
If you looked at,

2126
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:52.500
if you failed

2127
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.520
at yesterday's high,

2128
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.660
the thought you would

2129
01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:55.380
be thinking about

2130
01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.800
would be trading back

2131
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.840
down to yesterday's low

2132
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.400
as a potential

2133
01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.400
destination trade.

2134
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.260
You look at the top

2135
01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:01.800
of a,

2136
01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.240
of a balance area high

2137
01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.040
and you fail.

2138
01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.200
You start thinking

2139
01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.380
that failed right there.

2140
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.640
You start thinking

2141
01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.840
the destination trade

2142
01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.480
down to the other end.

2143
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.860
Down on this side,

2144
01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.020
look at the gap.

2145
01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:14.720
Okay.

2146
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.200
The gap,

2147
01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:15.840
you got a little

2148
01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.820
balance down here.

2149
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:17.980
A gap is what?

2150
01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:19.120
It's a reorder of

2151
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.280
thinking.

2152
01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:21.140
It's a,

2153
01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.520
going back to Kuhn,

2154
01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.020
it's a paradigm shift.

2155
01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:24.940
We just happened to

2156
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.260
use it in a much

2157
01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.220
smaller time frame

2158
01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:27.800
than he would have

2159
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.220
used it.

2160
01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.920
A gap is also what?

2161
01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:33.080
It's also excess.

2162
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.180
I got a little excess

2163
01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:34.520
there.

2164
01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.580
The gap is excess,

2165
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.820
which actually confirms

2166
01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:38.120
this.

2167
01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.400
The market's off

2168
01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:39.820
and running.

2169
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.300
I could go up there,

2170
01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.120
back down to the

2171
01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.080
destination trade.

2172
01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.300
Does it always

2173
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:45.080
happen nicely?

2174
01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.300
No, it doesn't.

2175
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.420
But at least it gives

2176
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.600
you some idea

2177
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.760
of the possibilities,

2178
01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.040
something to think

2179
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.280
about and something

2180
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.420
to judge what is,

2181
01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.320
what is occurring

2182
01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.080
in the marketplace.

2183
01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.520
That's the

2184
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2185
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2186
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2187
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2188
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2189
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2190
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2191
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2192
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2193
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2194
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2195
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2196
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2197
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2198
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2199
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2200
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2201
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2202
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2203
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2204
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2205
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2206
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2207
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2208
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2209
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2210
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2211
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2212
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2213
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2214
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2215
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2216
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2217
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2218
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2219
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2220
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2221
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2222
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2223
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2224
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2225
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2226
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2227
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2228
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2229
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2230
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2231
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2232
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:02.520


2233
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.520
Thank you.
