<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>THINK DIFFUSION MODEL</blockquote>
<blockquote>MINI , .</blockquote>
<blockquote>i a :</blockquote>
<blockquote>0) ut iy</blockquote></p>
<p>We said we're going to go back and refer again to the diffusion model. And what you want to think about, here's the excess low on the 5th of February. And this would have been, you know, on the S&Ps.</p>
<p><h3>[0:30 - 1:00] `frame_0002.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And this would have been, you know, on the S&Ps. Now review. Who made that low? When you think of diffusion model, who caused the low? Laggard what? Laggard shorts. As the other laggard, laggard longs, right? The last longs, laggard longs capitulated, sold into it. The ones that hadn't gone out, hanging on to the very end by their fingernails.</p>
<p><h3>[1:00 - 1:30] `frame_0003.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Those that hadn't shorted, the laggard shorts. And then they were met by whom at the very bottom? The innovators. I don't know if we've got this on the next slide. We'll see in a minute. This was, not only does the excess show here, the excess shows also very, very well on the day timeframe profile. Matter of fact, it was a very expensive operation because I was leaving Chicago that day when</p>
<p><h3>[1:30 - 2:00] `frame_0004.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Matter of fact, it was a very expensive operation because I was leaving Chicago that day when that happened. I was just checking out of the hotel and it broke and left the excess. And of course, I wasn't going to do it on the plane. But I did see this developing. So the first thing is, two sets of laggards. The laggard's long. Those that hadn't gotten out, finally capitulated down here. Then you get those that hadn't shorted, that finally threw in the towel and shorted. And they were met by the innovator. And it was a meaningful excess. And you can look at that and you can see how easy it is to identify that excess.</p>
<p><h3>[2:00 - 2:30] `frame_0005.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And you can look at that and you can see how easy it is to identify that excess. Now, remember, this market has come down a long way. I think that was something in the order of 7 or 8% decline, if I remember right. So what have traders and what have investors been seeing the whole way down? Lower prices, lower prices, lower prices, right? The best trade flies in the face of what? The most recent market activity.</p>
<p><h3>[2:30 - 3:00] `frame_0006.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>FOLLOWING EXCESS YOU</blockquote>
<blockquote>CAN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT</blockquote>
<blockquote>STRATEGY AND TACTICS</blockquote>
<blockquote>RATHER THAN COMING IN</blockquote>
<blockquote>EACH DAY WITHA BLANK</blockquote>
<blockquote>TABLET</blockquote></p>
<p>The most recent market activity. And while it looks pretty clear right now, boy, it's a tough trade at the time that it's happening. When you start to think about the emotions, how much you second guess yourself. But if you can get your emotions control and you look and say, wait a minute, I understand excess. Then the market started back up. Okay. This, what is this area right here? This would be what?</p>
<p><h3>[3:00 - 3:30] `frame_0007.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Balance, right? So I have a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 day balance. The breakout of balance. I have a term. I call it clean or unclean. A clean balance means that the next balance is cleanly above the lower balance. Okay. Is the next balance cleanly above the lower balance? I said at least earlier, you ought to be able to put your finger or pencil mark between them. I can put my car between it. Is the auction young or old?</p>
<p><h3>[3:30 - 4:00] `frame_0008.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Is the auction young or old? Young. The auction is young. Now we balance again. Even on the balance, what did we get? Excess. We got excess, right? So now, then we balance here, a little balance. But we're still, then we get another breakout, young or old? Yeah. Okay. If you get yourself tied up with price, oh my, this is too high. I'm not buying it here. You're going to have a terrible time and you're going to end up going the wrong way. If you look in here and you say, wait a minute, whether this auction is any good, whether it's</p>
<p><h3>[4:00 - 4:30] `frame_0009.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If you look in here and you say, wait a minute, whether this auction is any good, whether it's lasting for a long period of time, I'm a trader. If I'm a trader, I'm not an economist. If I'm a trader, I'm looking at market generated information. And the market generated information is clearly going where? It's clearly going higher. I can see it by drawing a trend line. I can see it by the balances. We have what we call value area trends where the value keeps going higher.</p>
<p><h3>[4:30 - 5:00] `frame_0010.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>FIELD OF VISION</blockquote>
<blockquote>WHEN YOU PUT THIS ALL</blockquote>
<blockquote>TOGETHER</blockquote></p>
<p>So again, one type of trading, one type of trading in here, right? Another type of trading in here. Go with trades here. Go with trades here. That's the process that goes on. But it started right here with the excess on February 5th. Now the other day when the market broke, it came all the way down to right here. What broke that thousand? What balanced or brought that thing back in the line? Was this excess low from February 5th?</p>
<p><h3>[5:00 - 5:30] `frame_0011.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Was this excess low from February 5th? Those references are important. When things like that take place, you have to be prepared. You have to know what to go look at very quickly. I wish I'd have been more prepared. I wasn't prepared and didn't mentally get it together fast enough. Okay. Let's take a look. Following excess, you can begin to think about strategy and tactics rather than coming each day with a blank tablet. Okay. Once I have excess, if I have excess and the excess is on the row, I start to think about my trading strategy being what?</p>
<p><h3>[5:30 - 6:00] `frame_0012.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Once I have excess, if I have excess and the excess is on the row, I start to think about my trading strategy being what? Buying breaks, selling rallies, right? Buying breaks, selling rallies. Going with the trend. Too many traders trade against the trend. And particularly they say, well, the market's been going down for months. We only got a few days going up. But remember what excess does. Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction. When we went down to the February 5th low, it certainly wasn't a scalper excess, right?</p>
<p><h3>[6:00 - 6:30] `frame_0013.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>When we went down to the February 5th low, it certainly wasn't a scalper excess, right? It certainly wasn't a daytime frame excess. And if it's down 7% or 8%, it's not going to be short-term excess because that's only 3 to 5 days. So at a minimum, what was my excess on the 5th of February? Intermediate-term excess at a minimum, right? So the longer the time frame the excess is for, the more significant it is. So my excess on February 6th was very significant down there.</p>
<p><h3>[6:30 - 7:00] `frame_0014.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So my excess on February 6th was very significant down there. And that's why the importance of making that identification, writing that down, will help get you in the right mental frame of mind and open your imagination. Wait a minute. That was intermediate-term excess. This could be a pretty significant auction to the upside. That starts to get you back in touch with what's going on in the market. All right. Field of vision. When you put it all together, what you really have is the field of vision.</p>
<p><h3>[7:00 - 7:30] `frame_0015.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>PRICE ADVERTISES</blockquote>
<blockquote>OPPORTUNITY</blockquote>
<blockquote>TIME REGULATES THIS</blockquote>
<blockquote>OPPORTUNITY</blockquote>
<blockquote>VOLUME MEASURES THE</blockquote>
<blockquote>SUCCES OR FAILURE OF THESE |</blockquote>
<blockquote>ADVERTISED OPPORTUNITIES</blockquote></p>
<p>When you put it all together, what you really have is the field of vision. This is what, this is the name of the video. This is where we've been going for. And as you spend the required time to put all the pieces together, when you get all said and done, you're going to look very much, you're going to play field hockey very much like Julia's friend, Megan. You're going to see the field of vision. You're going to be able to shoot straight when you go for the gold.</p>
<p><h3>[7:30 - 8:00] `frame_0016.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You're going to be able to shoot straight when you go for the gold. Okay? Talk a little bit about volume. The majority of studies that you will read will tell you that volume doesn't matter. What that really means is that they haven't figured out how to use volume yet. When people do research, what they tend to do to go to the University of Chicago, I think it's called CRISPR, Center for Research and Security Prices,</p>
<p><h3>[8:00 - 8:30] `frame_0017.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>When people do research, what they tend to do to go to the University of Chicago, I think it's called CRISPR, Center for Research and Security Prices, and they buy these streams of data that go back for many years. These streams of data are only price data. There's no context on the data. They don't know if the price was made on old business or new business. Old business would be short covering or old business would be long liquidation. New business would be new money coming in the market or new shorts being set in the market. They have no, there's no context.</p>
<p><h2>Section 2: They have no, there's no context</h2></p>
<p><h3>[8:30 - 9:00] `frame_0018.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They have no, there's no context. They don't know if the price was made on high volume or low volume. They treat all prices as equal. Anybody in any kind of business intuitively knows that all prices are not equal. No two opportunities are the same. So they take this data. They can't intuitively resist these scientists that should be smart. And we're talking literally people from the atomic energy research people, you know, out west. Los Alamos truly scientists come out of there, been hired by these firms to do this research,</p>
<p><h3>[9:00 - 9:30] `frame_0019.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>VOLUME MUST BE</blockquote>
<blockquote>USED</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONTEXUALLY</blockquote></p>
<p>Los Alamos truly scientists come out of there, been hired by these firms to do this research, and they make the same basic mistake. They start with data that's not reliable, but they can't resist. How can I not work with 40 years of data, right? But there's no context. It's meaning. So volume, there's studies come out and tell you volume doesn't matter. Okay? Volume doesn't matter. Anybody in business, if you raise your price and your volume drops off, you know it matters. Does that mean that it's going to go down and correct immediately?</p>
<p><h3>[9:30 - 10:00] `frame_0020.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Does that mean that it's going to go down and correct immediately? No. But you certainly have to monitor it and you have to make adjustments. Now, price advertises opportunity, time regulates opportunity, and volume measures the success or failure of the advertised opportunity. But let's put some context around volume. Volume is like anything else. If, for example, let's move forward just a little bit here. Volume in a balanced area is not nearly as important.</p>
<p><h3>[10:00 - 10:30] `frame_0021.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Volume in a balanced area is not nearly as important. So if I'm in a trading area, I'm in a four-day or five-day trading range, the market is fairly well balanced. Volume is relatively insignificant because all the market's doing, it's found a place where two-sided trade can take place. The market's just kind of going back and forth on a balancing area. And volume isn't, it's not unimportant. Okay? If you have an up-day or down-day with significantly light or low volume, I will take it into account</p>
<p><h3>[10:30 - 11:00] `frame_0022.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If you have an up-day or down-day with significantly light or low volume, I will take it into account and I do track it. But where volume is really important is when I break out, if I break out of this four-day balance to the upside. Okay? I'm getting away. So I'll have a Ferris Price to do business for four days just as I have a Ferris Price to do business for a single day. Right? So in order to get away from the Ferris Price to do business, I'm going to need volume. If I don't have volume, Ferris Price to do business is going to act very much like a magnet</p>
<p><h3>[11:00 - 11:30] `frame_0023.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If I don't have volume, Ferris Price to do business is going to act very much like a magnet and pull price back to it. So in order to get away from it, I'm going to need volume. And what I want to see if I break out of an area, I want to see that higher prices begin to bring in more volume. Or if it's going the other way, I want to see that it's bringing in even less volume. So volume in breakouts from balance, far more important than the volume that takes place within a balanced area.</p>
<p><h3>[11:30 - 12:00] `frame_0024.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>VOLUME IN BALANCING AREAS IS</blockquote>
<blockquote>NOT NEARLY AS IMPORTANT</blockquote></p>
<p>within a balanced area. Now, that all sounds nice, but let's be honest. We went through a period when the market went up to new highs before it made this historic break a few days to go. It took it down 1,000 points, and volume was terrible on the upside. So everybody said, well, Jim, what about this volume? Well, all I can say at the point is volume wasn't high, but the market kept going up.</p>
<p><h3>[12:00 - 12:30] `frame_0025.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Well, all I can say at the point is volume wasn't high, but the market kept going up. Okay. And why did the market keep going up? The momentum traders were there. Momentum traders are generally non-thinking traders. Whatever it is, they're going to go with it. They're like the people at the pari-mutual board that we showed before. You know, if you can bet on the race until it's over, you just keep throwing your money at it, even if the risk return doesn't make sense. You just keep going with the momentum. Then you've got, and I was listening one day to one of the guys on CNBC, and they were talking</p>
<p><h3>[12:30 - 13:00] `frame_0026.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Then you've got, and I was listening one day to one of the guys on CNBC, and they were talking to him. He's leaning. He's got this picture of him leaning against the door for him, and he said, I really don't like the market in here. We don't like the market, but you know, everybody is, it's going up, so we're not going to sell. We don't want to sell right now. Nobody wants to sell first. Nobody wants to sell first. So then his comment was, he said, but we're leaning, we're leaning in the door frame so we can be the first out if this thing breaks.</p>
<p><h3>[13:00 - 13:30] `frame_0027.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>we can be the first out if this thing breaks. Now, do you think he was the only one leaning in the door frame? He wasn't the only one leaning in the door frame. And people said, well, how could the market go down that far? Because they were all leaning, in my opinion, the structure, the volume underneath it was not supportive of what happened. They're all leaning in the door frame, and they're all trying to get out. You know, it's like a fire get out at the same time. So we were out of line volume-wise for a long period of time. And a lot of people that, you know, listen to what I say and what I write, were having</p>
<p><h3>[13:30 - 14:00] `frame_0028.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>VOLUME IN BREAKOUTS FROM</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALANCE MORE RELEVANT</blockquote>
<blockquote>EXCESS ——- il}</blockquote>
<blockquote>JANUARY 10 BALANCE</blockquote>

<blockquote>NON LINEAR ttt ace, ae</blockquote>
<blockquote>BREAK</blockquote>

<blockquote>BALANCE</blockquote>
<blockquote>BALANCE</blockquote></p>
<p>And a lot of people that, you know, listen to what I say and what I write, were having some serious questions about this and say, it's not a bank. But at the same time, people that read, I'm still a realist. If I got a three-day balance, what am I going to do, guys? I'm going with a breakout from the three-day balance, right? I will understand that my structure underneath isn't right. I will have the stops. I will be protective. But I'm not going to sit there and fight the trend just because the volume isn't there. But I do know, I do know that the potential for something to go very, very wrong is building</p>
<p><h3>[14:00 - 14:30] `frame_0029.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But I do know, I do know that the potential for something to go very, very wrong is building in that market. And that's exactly what happened. It's, and it's so many of the people here that are our guests today have read some of these things. So they know that this isn't something that was just kind of dreamed up after the fact. Now, and some of my longer-term clients took good use of it because they were structured correctly in their longer-term portfolios.</p>
<p><h3>[14:30 - 15:00] `frame_0030.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>correctly in their longer-term portfolios. So volume, also, when you're going up on low volume, even though you're going higher, what is happening to the odds, the odds of being long? You're still going higher. But your odds are doing what? Are they increasing? The odds of being successful. Increasing or decreasing? They're decreasing. They're going against you, right? You're like you're at the tote board and you're down to the point where you're going to get a 201 payoff for $2.</p>
<p><h3>[15:00 - 15:30] `frame_0031.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>a 201 payoff for $2. The risk-reward doesn't make any sense. Because I'm always taken about the comment that Prince made when he was asked at Citibank, why didn't they get out of some of this toxic stuff? Everybody remember what his answer was? He said, well, everybody was still dancing. Everybody was still dancing. In other words, they claimed they saw the risk, but they didn't get out because everybody was still dancing. So they were leaning against the doorframe so they could get out, right?</p>
<p><h3>[15:30 - 16:00] `frame_0032.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So they were leaning against the doorframe so they could get out, right? Those things happen. That's where bubbles come from. That's where excesses come from in the market. Let me put it in the same kind of terms that I talked about yesterday. I said I ran an institutional trading desk. Let's talk about the mentality of the longer-term traders. And those were a lot of our customers. Let's say that you are the head trading manager or senior portfolio manager for a very large fund.</p>
<p><h3>[16:00 - 16:30] `frame_0033.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>NEW BUSINESS VOLUME</blockquote>
<blockquote>VERSUS OLD BUSINESS</blockquote>
<blockquote>VOLUME</blockquote>
<blockquote>LACK OF ELONGATION</blockquote>
<blockquote>POINT OF CONTROL DOESN'T</blockquote>
<blockquote>MIGRATE IN DIRECTION OF</blockquote>
<blockquote>PRICE</blockquote></p>
<p>Let's say that you are the head trading manager or senior portfolio manager for a very large fund. They'll all deny this probably, but markets going up. And all of a sudden, you are the first one out of the market. Okay? And let's say you're absolutely right. You're one out, two, three, and four are right behind you, and you really look great. But so quickly, you get lost within the crowd. You don't get any special credit for being the first one, right?</p>
<p><h2>Section 3: You don't get any special credit for being the first one,</h2></p>
<p><h3>[16:30 - 17:00] `frame_0034.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You don't get any special credit for being the first one, right? Because everybody's selling. You may have been first, but everybody's selling. You don't get any special credit. Now, let's say you're the first one to sell and nobody else sells. Now, do you get any special recognition? You're the only one that sold. Nobody else did. You're out there on a limb by yourself. And the example I gave yesterday, you probably worked for a suit.</p>
<p><h3>[17:00 - 17:30] `frame_0035.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I was one of those suits. I have my traders out here. I'm a trading desk. And we did business with institutions. You know, but I know how you think. You say, well, why in the world would you sell that? Nobody else was selling. Typical response that you might expect. So why? Why should they take that chance? Because actually, by being right, for the one time they're right, if they're wrong, their job may be at stake. So it is very understandable to me that these markets can go to extremes without people getting out of the market.</p>
<p><h3>[17:30 - 18:00] `frame_0036.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So it is very understandable to me that these markets can go to extremes without people getting out of the market. Because nobody wants to be first and take that risk. There is actually less risk in the institutional business, the big money business. There's less risk in being with the crowd and having relative performance than there is being against the crowd. Now, we said the money, the guy that made all the money on the mortgage problem with the mortgage area was Paulson. Did he work for a large institution? No. Ran his own hedge fund, right? Who did he report to?</p>
<p><h3>[18:00 - 18:30] `frame_0037.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>Who did he report to? He reported to himself. He had the money that he had in, he had locked up. He had letters that had the money locked up. Guess what? And when you read the big short, how many remember, how early was he on the trade? He was early. He was two years early on a lot of it, right? Two years early. Well, now, if you worked in an institution and you're two years early, I don't know what institution you're going to be working for by the time what you were playing for actually happened. So understanding those dynamics are very important within the marketplace.</p>
<p><h3>[18:30 - 19:00] `frame_0038.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So understanding those dynamics are very important within the marketplace. Because a lot of times people say, well, how in the world could that happen? It's understanding the behavior. Once we got the breakout the other day, what happened to volume? I think they reported one day on the break we had record volume. Well, they were all standing in the door trying to get out. Okay. Again, we can't cover it all today and all in one video, but we can at least give you some understanding of the dynamics of what makes up the market.</p>
<p><h3>[19:00 - 19:30] `frame_0039.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Again, we can't cover it all today and all in one video, but we can at least give you some understanding of the dynamics of what makes up the market. Because we're talking about market understanding, we're talking about logic, and we're talking about self-understanding. So we've got market understanding, market logic, self-understanding. All of these things are important in order to get a holistic view of what trading is about and start to put together the good trades. Okay. And then we're also looking if we're looking at something. We put a trade on, and once we put the trade on, we do what?</p>
<p><h3>[19:30 - 20:00] `frame_0040.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We put a trade on, and once we put the trade on, we do what? Monitor for continuation. So let's say I'm going long the market. Let's say the market starts with short coverage. Okay. Old business or new business? It's old business. Okay. The chances of old business driving the market higher are reduced, even though we looked at an earlier example with a 10-year bond was at historic rates or historic short interest.</p>
<p><h3>[20:00 - 20:30] `frame_0041.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The chances of old business driving the market higher are reduced, even though we looked at an earlier example with a 10-year bond was at historic rates or historic short interest. That did drive the market considerably higher. It will happen. But generally speaking, old business isn't going to take it as high as a combination of old business and new business. So if we're monitoring for continuation, we would look and we'd say if it's old business going up, we kind of get the P formation. It doesn't mean it's over. Okay. If we're monitoring for continuation, the healthiest profiles are going to get elongation because the market's doing a good job of facilitating trade higher and higher.</p>
<p><h3>[20:30 - 21:00] `frame_0042.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>TRADE LOCATION CAN IMPACT VOLUME</blockquote></p>
<p>If we're monitoring for continuation, the healthiest profiles are going to get elongation because the market's doing a good job of facilitating trade higher and higher. The point of control either does or doesn't migrate in the direction of price. So if we're getting a good breakout to the upside, for example, we're going to have a combination of new business and old business. We're going to get elongation and we're going to get a point of control that migrates higher. If my breakout or monitor for continuation, it's not very good to the upside. I've got old business versus new business.</p>
<p><h3>[21:00 - 21:30] `frame_0043.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I've got old business versus new business. I don't get elongation and my point of control doesn't migrate higher. Remember early on we showed a place where price was going lower. The point of control did not migrate lower. We had almost a 45 degree angle and we saw a recovery of a big break late in the afternoon. So you're trying to put these things together in order to understand the dynamics. Okay. Volume and attempted direction.</p>
<p><h3>[21:30 - 22:00] `frame_0044.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Volume and attempted direction. When you look at volume, you have to know what was the market trying to do today. Volume is not relevant if you don't know what the market was trying to do. So if the market opens in the middle, goes up, goes down, goes up, goes down, and you don't have any clear attempted direction, you don't know what the market was trying to do. Volume is not relevant.</p>
<p><h3>[22:00 - 22:30] `frame_0045.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Volume is only relevant on those days when you know what the market was trying to do. So if I know the market was trying to go higher, my question then becomes, what was the market trying to do and how good a job did it do of what it was attempting to do. So if I open on the low, it's trying to go higher. And if it's really good, I'm going to get increasing volume, I'm going to get elongation, and I'm going to just have a nice healthy market.</p>

<p>And if it's really good, I'm going to get increasing volume, I'm going to get elongation, and I'm going to just have a nice healthy market. So if it opens on the low, trying to go higher, and volume diminishes, it's not a healthy day. So without knowing attempted direction, volume will terribly, terribly mislead you. So in here, volume auctions in both directions doesn't mean much. Over here, opens an auction up. We have a pretty clear indication of what it was trying to do. Volume is much more meaningful on this particular day.</p>
<p><h3>[23:00 - 23:30] `frame_0047.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Volume is much more meaningful on this particular day. Okay? Trade location can impact volume. This is a big one. What happens many times, we talked earlier, we came across a major reference. Up here. When a market comes to a major reference point, you're going up, you're going up, you're at a major reference point. And we had this example work very, very well yesterday. And I said, from a trading standpoint, if I've got a market going up to a major reference,</p>
<p><h3>[23:30 - 24:00] `frame_0048.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And I said, from a trading standpoint, if I've got a market going up to a major reference, I am going to exit the trade on this side of the reference. I will put the trade back on if it's accepted on the other side of the reference. So let's say I have a five-month trading high. So I have a five-month bracket trading range. I go up there. I'm going to take the long off on this side. That is my high-risk area right there.</p>
<p><h3>[24:00 - 24:30] `frame_0049.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We saw one yesterday. It didn't make it. I think a lot of people thought we were going through. It didn't make it. The longer it took, it didn't make it. As the day went on, we started to break away from it to the downside pretty quickly. That is the high-risk area. I'd rather, I have less risk by coming out at a lower price, reestablishing it once it's cleared, the top of the range, and reestablishing the trade. That's what professional traders do. That's the high-risk area.</p>
<p><h3>[24:30 - 25:00] `frame_0050.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>That's the high-risk area. Now, when you're coming up to that very key reference point, it's got to usually be a very key reference point. What you may see is volume, you may see volume diminishing. We had another example yesterday where we saw volume diminish up there. It got very fat. We saw it diminish. And then, just before the market closed, we saw a breakout to the upside. Well, you say, well, Jim, well, wait a minute.</p>

<p>Well, you say, well, Jim, well, wait a minute. The volume was really low. Well, the nuance was, and we said earlier nuance is important. The nuance was that it was up near a significant reference. Longer, smarter term traders would rather take it off on this side. They would rather reestablish their long positions on the other side. So, you could say, well, wait a minute. We're at the bracket extreme and volume dried up. Not necessarily negative. You've got to relate it to where it was in the trade location.</p>
<p><h3>[25:30 - 26:00] `frame_0052.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You've got to relate it to where it was in the trade location. And understand, it would be very logical. If I come up here trying to take this out, it would be very logical I come out at this side, even though this one went through. But it was just to give an example. Take it off at a major reference. Put it back on if it breaks out on the other side. Okay. Okay. When I'm trading, there's a couple different places I can get volume. If I'm trading currencies, the only volume that I'm aware of, Paul, are you still trading currencies?</p>
<p><h3>[26:00 - 26:30] `frame_0053.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If I'm trading currencies, the only volume that I'm aware of, Paul, are you still trading currencies? Yeah. Okay. Where do you get volume from? CME. So, you're using futures volume. CME. That's the only volume you have available to you, right? Yes. So, if you're trading futures in, say, currencies or cash bonds or something like that, the only place you're going to get the real volume is from the futures volume. My rule is I always go to best source. And the best source, in that case, may be the futures.</p>
<p><h3>[26:30 - 27:00] `frame_0054.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And the best source, in that case, may be the futures. If, in fact, I'm trading stocks, I go to the New York Stock Exchange and I use the composite volume from the New York Stock Exchange because I find that is a better source than is the futures volume. So, my basic rule is go where I can get the best source volume. Okay. And then I look at it on a relative basis. Now, and here's what I do on my volume if I'm trading, for example, S&Ps.</p>
<p><h3>[27:00 - 27:30] `frame_0055.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Now, and here's what I do on my volume if I'm trading, for example, S&Ps. I take, this is B period. Let's say that's the opening. I look in the first period. I traded 650,000 contracts, 935, a billion three. I'm looking. I just track it. I'm not totally up to date, but I just track it throughout the day. I look at what the total is. So, I always have some idea of what the volume is doing. I know what it's doing for the period.</p>
<p><h3>[27:30 - 28:00] `frame_0056.jpg`</h3></p>

<blockquote>EMOTIONS WHEN IT REALLY COUNTS</blockquote></p>
<p>I know what it's doing for the period. I know what it's doing throughout the day. I know what it's doing total. But I'm using New York Stock Exchange composite volume, which, if I understand it correctly, is all the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the volume from as many sources as they can pull it. This is my best source. So, again, if I don't have anything else, I'll use futures. But I do not use futures volume when trading the S&Ps. This is a better source, and it's more reliable.</p>
<p><h3>[28:00 - 28:30] `frame_0057.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>This is a better source, and it's more reliable. Okay? Preparing to trade. We heard this before, right? Literally all performance literature recognizes the connection between performance and preparation. Without preparation, we are unlikely, and you've heard it before, overcome the emotions that really cost us very dearly in the market. Just to recap, I said early, once you have good market understanding, when you talk about traders that really do understand markets, they've got years of experience, once they got through the place where they understand the markets, they'll tell you that about 80% of their performance is tied to their emotional control or lack thereof.</p>
<p><h3>[28:30 - 29:00] `frame_0058.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Just to recap, I said early, once you have good market understanding, when you talk about traders that really do understand markets, they've got years of experience, once they got through the place where they understand the markets, they'll tell you that about 80% of their performance is tied to their emotional control or lack thereof. Now, part of the difficulty in learning to trade, people say, well, they want to get their emotions under control first. Well, if you don't understand how the markets work, it's pretty hard to work on the emotions because you really don't know. You need a foundation.</p>
<p><h3>[29:00 - 29:30] `frame_0059.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You need a foundation. You need to understand you really do understand the markets, then to start to identify the emotional issues and really deal with them. So, you know, it's hard, in my opinion, to work on both of them together. I think you need that market understanding. And as I told one of the folks that helped set all this up in the first place, what we do on market understanding probably ought to come first, and then the second step ought to be the psychological understanding. One of the individuals in our class today works with traders on the emotional side of the market.</p>

<p>One of the individuals in our class today works with traders on the emotional side of the market. But also, he trades for himself. He trades for himself. He understands the markets. He's getting better and better and teaches the emotion. You want to talk about somebody that's powerful? Try and teach the emotional aspects of it when you don't understand trading, you don't understand what the trader's dealing with. That's pretty tough. I mean, you're doing it in a vacuum. Take somebody like Mark that understands the trading aspects and is going through this in detail and with all the material.</p>
<p><h3>[30:00 - 30:30] `frame_0061.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Take somebody like Mark that understands the trading aspects and is going through this in detail and with all the material. And now combine that with the emotional understanding. All of a sudden, you've got a much more powerful weapon out there. And that's really what it takes. It is a combination of both. And the preparation, being prepared, does an awful lot to get those emotions in check. When you're not prepared, you're walking in cold, you can have a lot of problems in the day.</p>
<p><h3>[30:30 - 31:00] `frame_0062.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Okay? Background. I mentioned this earlier. You need to make, and you're doing your preparation, you need to make a statement. What's driving the market? Okay? Sometimes you have a market that's totally trading on its own. A really strong market with strong conviction trades on its own, and it doesn't care what is going on in any other market. The kind of markets that you get hurt in are the markets that are not trading on their own.</p>
<p><h3>[31:00 - 31:30] `frame_0063.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The kind of markets that you get hurt in are the markets that are not trading on their own. They're getting whipsawed by other markets and other inflows. Those are markets with low conviction. Those are markets that traders get cut off on very badly sometimes because they have no idea what's going on. I just threw one example up here. This was the S&P's. It was on a Thursday. Here is the market. There is the high on the S&P.</p>
<p><h3>[31:30 - 32:00] `frame_0064.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>There is the low on the dollar. So the market was trading off of the dollar. There is the low on the S&P. There's the high on the dollar. Try and trade that market. Try and trade the S&P's. When you have no idea this is what's going on, that makes it pretty tough. You're going to get whipped very solidly. So you ought to make a note. Is the market trading on its own or is it not trading on its own? Bonds, if you trade bonds.</p>

<p>Bonds, if you trade bonds. Are bonds trading on their own? Or are they being driven by flight to safety or flight to quality of what's going on in Greece, in Portugal, in Spain? Okay. Those are real things that happen in the marketplace. Whether they make sense or not. When you look at the long-term research, the correlation between stocks and currencies is very questionable. When you really look at it academically over a long-term basis.</p>
<p><h3>[32:30 - 33:00] `frame_0066.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>When you really look at it academically over a long-term basis. But guess what? In the real world, if this is what the market is doing this week, this month, or the next two months, guess what? That's what matters. You're traders. You're going to be a trader. You have to understand these relationships. And these things happen all the time. So if you start out by just making a small statement as you're preparing to trade and say, hey, this market is weak. It's not trading on its own. Next, I start with a top-down approach.</p>
<p><h3>[33:00 - 33:30] `frame_0067.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>What I'm trying to do is always get as broad a perspective as I can. I start from the top down. Then I get all the way down finally so I can develop my strategy and my tactics. If I start here, I look at a monthly. I look at a monthly. I look at a weekly. Then I come over here and I look at a daily. So if I just take the monthly, the weekly, and the daily, do you see the same perspective looking at all of those?</p>
<p><h2>Section 5: So if I just take the monthly, the weekly, and the daily,</h2></p>
<p><h3>[33:30 - 34:00] `frame_0068.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So if I just take the monthly, the weekly, and the daily, do you see the same perspective looking at all of those? Or does each one of those give you a slightly different perspective of what's going on in the marketplace? You know, there's the weekly. The weeklies come down to here, right? There's the daily going up to here. So you can get, there's the best top reference up there. We just broke above this area right here. Okay? So I've got a breakout. I've got a breakout on the weekly chart above this level.</p>

<p>I've got a breakout on the weekly chart above this level. Which takes precedent? The weekly or the daily? It's going to be the weekly because the longer the time frame, the more relevant it is. So that's where I start. I start with the background. I then look at the monthly, the weekly, the daily. And I just keep walking through this from a top-down approach. Okay? Let's take a look. In a trending market, where are we in the trend? You've seen some of these charts before. Am I in the early part of the trend?</p>
<p><h3>[34:30 - 35:00] `frame_0070.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Am I in the early part of the trend? Am I in the late part of the trend? Here I had a multi-day, well right here, when it got here, I had a four-day balance, a three-day balance, right? I looked before it, and I failed. I came back up. Okay? So now I've got a longer balance. But right here, I would have looked below this. I looked on this day. I probably got some follow-through early in the morning. Got rejected. I have excess. So I'm looking. Not only am I starting very big, but I keep coming down into smaller and smaller time frames.</p>
<p><h3>[35:00 - 35:30] `frame_0071.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Not only am I starting very big, but I keep coming down into smaller and smaller time frames. Most of my trading is pretty short term. So I keep coming down to what am I strategy? What's my tactics going to be? And I just start the top-down. And then I start looking at and working at it a step at a time. Okay? What time frame is controlling the market? You know, is it the day time frame? Let's say I have three days of balance where the market does nothing. It stays very tight for three days.</p>
<p><h3>[35:30 - 36:00] `frame_0072.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It stays very tight for three days. Who's probably controlling that market? Probably the day time frame, right? Now, I've got every day I'm getting higher value. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Who do you think is controlling that market? Probably not the day time frame, right? At a minimum, it's the short time frame. If it's more than three to five days, it's probably at least the intermediate term time frame. The bigger the time frame, the more significant what is occurring in the market is happening. I'll look and I'll see where's the center of the ring, just to have some idea where my trade location is.</p>
<p><h3>[36:00 - 36:30] `frame_0073.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I'll look and I'll see where's the center of the ring, just to have some idea where my trade location is. These are all charts you've seen before. But they become part of what I do for my daily preparation to trade. Okay? Now, an inside day. An inside day is a form of what? It's a form of balance, right? I can have balance. I can have five months of balance. I can have three weeks of balance. If I'm trading 30-minute bars, I can have three periods of balance.</p>
<p><h3>[36:30 - 37:00] `frame_0074.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>If I'm trading 30-minute bars, I can have three periods of balance. An inside day is balance. The market has come into balance. Okay? When I come into balance, I find very little incentive to take any trade home from balance. In balance, the market is looking for more information before it makes its next directional move. So what I want to do is be prepared to trade any move outside of balance. So I say, okay, if I get an inside day, I've got balance.</p>
<p><h3>[37:00 - 37:30] `frame_0075.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So I say, okay, if I get an inside day, I've got balance. I start thinking I've got three scenarios, right? Scenario one, it stays in balance. Scenario two, it looks outside of balance. Fails, come back in. Scenario three, it goes. So here, if I have an inside day, if the market opens and starts to trade out of balance to the downside, I won't go with that trade in the morning. The concepts are the same if you're using 30-minute bars throughout the day. I don't care. I use 30-minute bars.</p>
<p><h3>[37:30 - 38:00] `frame_0076.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But the concepts, no matter what time frame you're talking about, the concepts are exactly the same. Okay? Okay? We've talked about this earlier, too. A trend we talk about is the market trending. It's not a mutually exclusive statement. You can have a long-term trend up. You can have an intermediate-term trend down within the long-term trend up. Be very natural, right? Markets trend up.</p>
<p><h3>[38:00 - 38:30] `frame_0077.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Markets trend up. You get an intermediate-term trend to the downside. Within the intermediate-term trend, you could have a short-term trend to the upside. And within the short-term trend to the upside, you could have a daytime frame trend to the downside. So they're not mutually exclusive. But, again, you need to have some idea of what is going on in the market. Right now, it sounds very ambiguous. As time goes on, you will find that this becomes more intuitive and more natural.</p>
<p><h3>[38:30 - 39:00] `frame_0078.jpg`</h3></p>

<blockquote>SHORT TERM</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAY TIMEFRAME</blockquote></p>
<p>As time goes on, you will find that this becomes more intuitive and more natural. I was telling the folks the other day, talking about when you get to be intuitive. For the first time the other day, I took a two-hour trip on a Segway off of Navy Pier here in Chicago. I've never been on a Segway. It's not, when I look at it, it's not very intuitive, right? To think you're going to stand on two wheels and you're not going to fall over and break your forehead or your back. So when you first get on, when you first get on that Segway, you're a little hesitant. You know, you put one foot up, keep the other foot on the ground.</p>
<p><h3>[39:00 - 39:30] `frame_0079.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You know, you put one foot up, keep the other foot on the ground. You kind of rock that one foot to make sure you're okay. And then the guy that, you got somebody coaching you and he's encouraging you, it'll be okay. He'll hold it and steady it for you, right? You're not sure if you believe him or not. You finally put the other foot up, he leaves go and guess what? You're standing straight up. You're not falling over forward or backwards. And then he said, okay, now here's how you go forward. You just kind of lean forward like you're going to fall. I'm not falling for that, right?</p>
<p><h3>[39:30 - 40:00] `frame_0080.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Oh, no. All of a sudden you lean forward and it starts to go. He said, when you want to stop, you just lean back. I'm not falling for that either, right? But I decide I want to stop, so I start to lean back. Within about 10 minutes, within about 10 minutes, all of a sudden you realize how intuitive the segue is. All of a sudden I'm coming down the street and I'm looking, there's a fire hydrant and it's like skis. All of a sudden you kind of go like this to the left of the fire hydrant, right around it to the right. You say, wait a minute. And that's kind of what happens to you over a period of time as you're in the market.</p>
<p><h3>[40:00 - 40:30] `frame_0081.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And that's kind of what happens to you over a period of time as you're in the market. You find out with the more experience you get, the more intuitive it comes. Okay. Identifying trading ranges and extremes. We've been through this again. They're not that hard to do. They kind of fall out. The markets are very what? They're very visual. Okay. They're very visual. And you start to be able to see these trading ranges. You start to be able to see excess.</p>
<p><h3>[40:30 - 41:00] `frame_0082.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You start to be able to see excess. Does it happen overnight? No. When you first start looking at it and say, well, you know, do I make it here? Do I make it here? Over a period of time, you start losing the ability to want to make it exactly linear. You start accepting that there's a little give and take in it. And you start to see, okay, I can see. I can see some balance. I can look here. I have a balance area here. I break out of this. And I said, okay, if it's a clean break, if it's a clean break, how much distance should</p>

<p>And I said, okay, if it's a clean break, if it's a clean break, how much distance should I have between this balance area and the next one? I should be able to put a pencil in my finger, right? When I look at this, it tried to break out of balance here. Is it clean? You see it? It's not clean. It's sitting right on top of it. It's back in it. And we come back down. Does that happen all the time? No. No. But it is something to record. But I got, and I got excess. I start to get more intuitive about excess.

<p>I start to get more intuitive about what is a profile going to look like at the end of the day, at a completed day. So you're identifying the ranges and the extremes. You're just trying to get a perspective of the marketplace. And if you move forward, what makes the market profile unique? We talked about it before, right? The synthesis, it combines everything. We saw the graphic of Napoleon going into Russia.</p>
<p><h3>[42:00 - 42:30] `frame_0085.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We saw the graphic of Napoleon going into Russia. We saw the holistic view of it. The very broad army, we saw the army narrow. We saw the temperatures rise. Are the temperatures lower? We saw the food supply dwindle. But if you then take it apart, we can study the size of the army. We can study the temperature. We can study the food supply separately, right? So we can take it apart and do more analysis. Successful trading is a combination of both, okay?</p>
<p><h3>[42:30 - 43:00] `frame_0086.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Again, review. When you go up, we have the first structure we looked at. What kind of business is this? Old business, right? It's short covering. Does short covering weaken or strengthen the market? It weakens the market because it takes buying power. We have a primary day. A primary day is a rename. If somebody is reading the original book, Mind Over Markets, we've changed the name on a few of the days because I think they're more meaningful names.</p>

<p>If somebody is reading the original book, Mind Over Markets, we've changed the name on a few of the days because I think they're more meaningful names. It's a primary day. It's kind of our base day that we judge all others from. On the side, we've got a liquidating day, a B formation. Old business and new business. It's old business, okay? And you just start to become second nature to you. Let's take a look a little further. We talk about combining things, analysis. So now, let's talk about the combination. I showed you how I track the volume. If I'm trading equities or the S&Ps, I track it by half-hour periods.</p>
<p><h3>[43:30 - 44:00] `frame_0088.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If I'm trading equities or the S&Ps, I track it by half-hour periods. I look at the total for the day. So now, let's see how I would put this together. Let's say that my attempted direction is up on the S&Ps today and my volume declines. Okay? I can make an analysis, right? Attempted direction up, I get lower volume. Or I have another day, attempted direction is up, and I get higher volume.</p>
<p><h3>[44:00 - 44:30] `frame_0089.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Or I have another day, attempted direction is up, and I get higher volume. So I can take and I'm doing my analysis. I can start to look at volume. I can look at it in relationship to attempted direction. I can look at it to was the value higher or lower? Was price higher or lower? You know, did I break out of it? I start to combine these together with my analysis. So it's not a single type.</p>
<p><h3>[44:30 - 45:00] `frame_0090.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So it's not a single type. It's not a single type of analysis. This is the really good traders. The really good traders do a wonderful job of maintaining holistic view of the marketplace, but also are also very astute in doing the work for analysis. So there's a combination of a little bit of a perfectionist and wanting linearity to it and versus keeping a holistic understanding. It takes, it takes, really takes a balance in there.</p>
<p><h3>[45:00 - 45:30] `frame_0091.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It takes, it takes, really takes a balance in there. What time frame is dominating the market? Day time frame references, we've talked about those. Double distribution days, we treat each as two separate days. Again, even on a double distribution day, I'd look to see what direction was the market trying to go. Even if I got it, I'd look at the volume, give me a better idea. We looked at three-day balance, day time frame references.</p>

<p>We've been through this process. We're just kind of reviewing through it. We've looked at anomalies before, right? Anomalies are rough edges on the profile. There are areas where there was lack symmetry. There's some kind of message in there. We look at another thing in the preparation from the NASDAQ. Now, the NASDAQ has a website, and everybody's got one someplace. But it allows you to go and see what news is scheduled to be announced on this particular day.</p>
<p><h3>[46:00 - 46:30] `frame_0093.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But it allows you to go and see what news is scheduled to be announced on this particular day. So on Monday, May 3rd, we can look up here, and we can see that we had personal income in outlays at 830. We had ISM manufacturing at 10, construction spending at 11. We come over here, and we see we have a 30-year bond auction announcement at 9 a.m. So we know what news is coming. It is important, particularly if you're a short-term trader, it is very important to know at what time a news announcement is coming.</p>
<p><h3>[46:30 - 47:00] `frame_0094.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It is important, particularly if you're a short-term trader, it is very important to know at what time a news announcement is coming. Now, I do not want to know what the news announcement is. I want to know when it's coming. I want to read the market's reaction to it on my own. If, in fact, I read the number, oh, and it looks like a bearish number, and I don't have the basis to know if it's a bearish number or not.</p>
<p><h3>[47:00 - 47:30] `frame_0095.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If, in fact, I read the number, oh, and it looks like a bearish number, and I don't have the basis to know if it's a bearish number or not. I'm reading the headline. The real information is down below the surface. It's below the adjustments. What was the expectation? I want to see how the market reacts in there, and I know there's a lot of crude traders in here. My biggest market has been on the NYMEX and the crude traders over the years. And, of course, you know, if you're a crude trader, you can't resist looking at the number, right?</p>
<p><h3>[47:30 - 48:00] `frame_0096.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And, of course, you know, if you're a crude trader, you can't resist looking at the number, right? You know, you're addicted to it, even though you know what my answer would be, right? And how many times do you see the market do just the opposite of what the number was? If you've got good structure, if you've got good solid structure on the market and the number is negative, a lot of times you get a fast dip down, it's gone. Or if there's a strong trend underway, the market doesn't care. Stocks have been going down recently. Good numbers, bad numbers. Doesn't make any difference. The market's going lower. All I want to know is what time is the announcement coming.</p>

<p>All I want to know is what time is the announcement coming. I want to know that because I can expect some volatility around that number, and I may elect not to have a position on at that time. If I'm going to have a position on, I want to at least understand what is going on in the marketplace. The narrative is nothing more than putting into words what you're seeing in the marketplace. It's the recap of all the work you've done.</p>
<p><h3>[48:30 - 49:00] `frame_0098.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It's the recap of all the work you've done. After you go through, you look at your references, you look at your background and everything else, you want to recap it into a narrative form, written form. You don't want it to be very big because you don't want to create a bottleneck. If you make it big and you write a book, all of a sudden it's like running. You run a half a mile today and a mile tomorrow. Within three days you're no longer running because it's too long. You don't want to create a bottleneck. But what everybody, nobody disagrees with me usually initially about this,</p>
<p><h3>[49:00 - 49:30] `frame_0099.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But what everybody, nobody disagrees with me usually initially about this, but the number of people that actually will do the narrative that we recommend is almost minuscule. Sounds good, but everybody knows that they know, they understand it, they know what's going on. They don't need to do that. All of a sudden you know what's going on. When you go to write a narrative, all of a sudden you start to write the narrative and the words don't flow very easily. What do you think your grasp is of what's really going on?</p>
<p><h2>Section 7: What do you think your grasp is of what's really going on?</h2></p>
<p><h3>[49:30 - 50:00] `frame_0100.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>What do you think your grasp is of what's really going on? It's not very good, right? If you're writing the narrative, you really understand what's going on, it ought to come off real quick and real smooth. The process of writing the narrative. Say, okay, the narrative may say nothing more. I'm in a 10-day balance. I'm in a 10-day balance. My trade location is at the top of the 10-day balance. Structure has not been very good on the upside. Volume has been declining. I'm looking for, I mean, I don't know what it's going to work.</p>
<p><h3>[50:00 - 50:30] `frame_0101.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>WHAT TIMEFRAME IS DOMINANT?</blockquote>
<blockquote>DAY TIMEFRAME REFERENCES</blockquote></p>
<p>I'm looking for, I mean, I don't know what it's going to work. We'll send you something to kind of help you with that. It doesn't have to be a book. But that, if you do that, you've got a much greater shot of doing the right thing when the market's open in the morning. Some people mistake a narrative. They spend a lot of work and they put in the reference points. They mark the reference points. And they've got stars here and notations here. That's linear work of marking the references. Easy to work. It's good work. Boy, you really feel busy.</p>
<p><h3>[50:30 - 51:00] `frame_0102.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Boy, you really feel busy. You know, you get straight edge out. You can draw trend lines. You can do this. You go, boy, I've really worked hard. But you haven't gone to another step of writing the narrative. If the background, maybe the narrative says nothing more. That the S&Ps are not trading on. They're not trading on their own. They're still being influenced by the movement in the dollar affected by what's going on in Europe and with the euro. Okay? You already knew that. But writing it down puts it in a different location in your mind and brings it front and center to what you're doing.</p>
<p><h3>[51:00 - 51:30] `frame_0103.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But writing it down puts it in a different location in your mind and brings it front and center to what you're doing. Also in the narrative, the very last portion of the narrative is you ought to develop two or three trading scenarios for tomorrow. So you ought to have two or three things that you know you want to do if you get the right opportunity tomorrow. It's a lot easier to react when you already have thought about it. There's enough things that come up in the market that we never thought about, didn't imagine, that come out of nowhere.</p>
<p><h3>[51:30 - 52:00] `frame_0104.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>There's enough things that come up in the market that we never thought about, didn't imagine, that come out of nowhere. If we can get rid of and be prepared for those that are expected, it's easier to handle the unexpected. But we will give you part of this when we get it done. We'll be a write-up on it. It's really a way to put it all together. Let's take a look now at what you might look at in a real week in the market.</p>
<p><h3>[52:00 - 52:30] `frame_0105.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The example provides us with an extreme unique opportunity to appreciate structure, how structure forms, how structure relates to object-based trading. And the intention of this market situation is to bring into focus those things that we have talked about today. So it's the week of April 9th to April 16th. Let's back up one slide for a second. So we are, there's the week we are focusing on in there.</p>

<p>So we are, there's the week we are focusing on in there. There's the 9th, there's the 16th. Okay? Let's go forward. Late Friday. Remember us talking about this day earlier? We showed this day earlier. Late Friday when sellers didn't appear, momentum traders pushed the prices back up. No elongation. Longer-term frame sellers have limited interest in here. Limited interest here we never would have gotten here.</p>
<p><h3>[53:00 - 53:30] `frame_0107.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Limited interest here we never would have gotten here. The low was made early. It was a poor low. Tempted direction was up. So that's my starting point. That happened on a Friday. We introduced this early. Now you're seeing it again. We're going to walk through what goes on. Now, when I look at the second day, well first of all, when I do my scenarios, I got a pretty good idea. I saw this day, this Friday. I knew there were no sellers, but I really didn't think this was real and I didn't think it could hold this.</p>
<p><h3>[53:30 - 54:00] `frame_0108.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I knew there were no sellers, but I really didn't think this was real and I didn't think it could hold this. It didn't have the volume. I didn't have the shape. I didn't have the conviction. I had a pretty good feeling that I had momentum players playing a game on Friday afternoon. Why? Because they can, right? And price-based traders, markets up. They buy it on Friday afternoon. It's like going to the track where you can change your bet. Why not? It's going up. So they come along. And on, this is a late spike. Let's talk about spikes for a second.</p>
<p><h3>[54:00 - 54:30] `frame_0109.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Let's talk about spikes for a second. This is another example of a spike late in the day or a price probe to the upside. Okay? If this is the late price probe up, this is the base of the spike. What is this called? Support, right? The base of the spike is support. If the market opens and stays within the spike, is the spike accepted or rejected? It's going to be accepted. Over time, we're getting accepted.</p>
<p><h3>[54:30 - 55:00] `frame_0110.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>Over time, we're getting accepted. If it opened above the spike, the market hadn't gone high enough to cut off the buy. So when I look at this, part of my scenario, I think there's a pretty good chance we're coming back here. But I don't know that. You never know anything for certain. Then I get a balanced, pretty balanced day on Monday. I'm within the spike, but it never got down here. It never got down through support.</p>
<p><h3>[55:00 - 55:30] `frame_0111.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Okay? So value is higher. However, no elongation. I have a wide point of control here. I have down here. No real evidence of longer term buyers because they really didn't push it. Sellers remain absent. Poor low. Poor low. Now I have a poor low here, right? And I have a poor low here. Let me give you another difficult concept. I don't use a point count, but let's assume that I did.</p>
<p><h3>[55:30 - 56:00] `frame_0112.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I don't use a point count, but let's assume that I did. Let's say if I had a poor low, I called it a minus five. So I'm doing some computer model. Poor low, I call it a minus five. Okay? I don't do that, but let's assume that I did. Now, if I had one poor low, that's a single data point. It may or not be taken out. It's significant. It's significant, but it's minor. If I have two poor lows back to back, I now start to get some exponential type of evidence.</p>
<p><h3>[56:00 - 56:30] `frame_0113.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If I have two poor lows back to back, I now start to get some exponential type of evidence. So if one poor low was minus five, maybe two poor lows back to back might be something like minus 25, minus 30, minus 35. So I kind of get an exponential expansion of two poor lows back to back. Are really increasing the odds. They're increasing the odds against that person that's long.</p>
<p><h3>[56:30 - 57:00] `frame_0114.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They're increasing the odds against that person that's long. They're increasing the odds that I'm going to have to look below those lows. So I go through that. I've got two poor lows back to back. I've got my support. I haven't gone through support here. Okay? So I've got, so I didn't get through support. That's positive, right? I got accepted, positive, but I got two back to back lows. Am I getting conflicting information? I'm getting conflicting information all the time. If, in fact, there was no conflicting information, the trend would be going in one direction.</p>

<p>If, in fact, there was no conflicting information, the trend would be going in one direction. Everybody would be very much aware of it, right? What is my opportunity? Pretty limited, right? Be very limited. Within the conflicting information starts to make the situation more ambiguous, right? Right? More ambiguous it is, the more opportunity I may have if I can wade through that and find</p>
<p><h3>[57:30 - 58:00] `frame_0116.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>More ambiguous it is, the more opportunity I may have if I can wade through that and find the opportunity within that ambiguity. Remember, most people loathe ambiguity. They want to know, where do I get in? Where do I get out? Jim, this is of no value to me. You didn't tell me where to buy. You didn't tell me where to sell. I don't need you. And you say, you know, that's not what we do. It's not really how markets work. And if it was that simple, it would be arbitraged away in moments. It would be in some computer program on some algorithm overnight.</p>
<p><h2>Section 8: It would be in some computer program on some algorithm</h2></p>
<p><h3>[58:00 - 58:30] `frame_0117.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It would be in some computer program on some algorithm overnight. Okay? The power in this is understanding the complexity and the ambiguity. So now I've got conflicting information. It was also interesting. One of my friends at a hedge fund told me, he said he was talking to other people at the hedge funds, and they had sworn off shorting. They had sworn off shorting because every time they shorted, they got punished. They got punished. They weren't going to short anymore.</p>
<p><h3>[58:30 - 59:00] `frame_0118.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They weren't going to short anymore. So I just wrote, I said, can the correction be far at hand? And it's amazing. Even hedge funds are supposed to be sophisticated. One of my jobs, when I went back to UBS in 2001, they had a problem in the hedge fund area. They were getting some suits, and I was asked to come back, review the process, and review a lot of the hedge funds that were in the system or should be in the systems, etc.</p>

<blockquote>WORK YOU'VE DONE</blockquote>
<blockquote>AND, IDENTIFYING</blockquote>
<blockquote>POTENTIAL TRADING</blockquote>
<blockquote>SCENARIOS</blockquote></p>
<p>a lot of the hedge funds that were in the system or should be in the systems, etc. So I went back. It was an interesting job. No hard feeling. My wife had passed away. They asked me to come back. It was an interesting situation. Very challenging. And it was fun. I learned more by talking to all these quote-unquote sophisticated hedge funds and traveling the country, talking to them, interviewing them. And it was also fun because I'd go in and they'd think, here's some guy from this brokerage</p>
<p><h3>[59:30 - 1:00:00] `frame_0120.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And it was also fun because I'd go in and they'd think, here's some guy from this brokerage firm. So they're just going to, you know, kind of blow a little smoke at you, close your eyelids, and you'd sit there and listen to them. And when they'd get done talking, you'd start to ask questions. And all of a sudden, they'd say, uh-oh. They'd start to get a little upset with some of the questions you ask. And all of a sudden, they realize, whoa, wait a minute. Maybe he doesn't know something about trading. Well, then you get in there and you start to say, wait a minute. What do they know about trading? And I can remember coming back from one trip and saying, every single hedge fund I talked</p>
<p><h3>[1:00:00 - 1:00:30] `frame_0121.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And I can remember coming back from one trip and saying, every single hedge fund I talked to on a swing through the West Coast, and I saw 10 of them and they were all pretty good size, every single one of them had the same basic position. Somebody came up to me earlier and they said it was amazing that I mentioned Bear Stearns because they said they used to be on the floor at the exchange. And they said, it was interesting, if Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs did a trade, Bear Stearns would imitate the trade immediately.</p>
<p><h3>[1:00:30 - 1:01:00] `frame_0122.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Stearns would imitate the trade immediately. Well, guess what? When you get everybody, longest time frame, going the same way, what is your risk? And when they try and get out the door, what do you think is going to happen? Okay. So when we go back and look at this, we've got two bad lows back-to-back on there. And we start to look at what's going on. Now, we come in on April 13th. We talked about this bad structure down here, the two bad lows.</p>
<p><h3>[1:01:00 - 1:01:30] `frame_0123.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We talked about this bad structure down here, the two bad lows. Now the market, we open lower, we go back. We don't take out this low, but we repair this. We take out this low. And the market has come back down and checked this out. Remember, I thought this was kind of bogus, the way it broke out above there. I think it's pretty hard to hold this when it's this fat. It got up here probably on a Friday afternoon, a couple bad lows. It did come back and check it out. The market, one of the things that's interesting here, the market is very much like we are as people.</p>

<p>The market, one of the things that's interesting here, the market is very much like we are as people. You know, I would really, as I'm sitting here doing this video, and I know some of you I've never met before. Some of you do know. And the temptation is you want to say, hey, how am I doing? Am I doing okay? Because it's all a little bit of our insecurity coming out, right? And the market is very similar. If you think about it, it's kind of, it's a composite. But this, in a way, I always have looked at this, it's like the market coming to check this out and saying, how am I doing?</p>
<p><h3>[1:02:00 - 1:02:30] `frame_0125.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But this, in a way, I always have looked at this, it's like the market coming to check this out and saying, how am I doing? Am I doing okay? And it comes down here. It comes, it revisits this area, kind of repairs this structure, and it gets an affirmation that everything's okay, right? And then, once it's checked this out, it gets encouragement, everything's okay. And the market starts back up. We get our buying tail, and we start to go back and auction higher. So the early break Tuesday repaired most of the, most of what was going on.</p>
<p><h3>[1:02:30 - 1:03:00] `frame_0126.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So the early break Tuesday repaired most of the, most of what was going on. Now, when we said we went down and then we went back up, one of the things we also were getting, what kind of information were we getting? Conflicting information, right? So guess what? Both of us, we got, we got, that took that conflicting information, we went lower, and we went higher. The question is, which one was going to happen first? But as long as you know that and you can go through that process, you can get prepared. If you had this as a reference point, your reference point, you get down there, you didn't take out Friday's low.</p>
<p><h3>[1:03:00 - 1:03:30] `frame_0127.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If you had this as a reference point, your reference point, you get down there, you didn't take out Friday's low. Do you have a reference? Should you have had that already on your chart? Yes, you should have. You get down there, you don't take it. Now, when you didn't take it, did it come out of here quickly or slowly? Came out pretty quickly, right? So as it got down, as it got down to the low on Friday, traders were ready to do what? Remember, on the floor, this means buy, right?</p>

<p>Remember, on the floor, this means buy, right? The longer the tail, the more aggressive they were. And they didn't even let it get to the low. So there was some aggressive buying going on. You've got excess. You saw excess a while ago, longer term excess from the February 5th low. You're seeing a little different type of excess right here. So there was conflicting information. But the pieces come together. And if you have a mental flexibility, you can make the analysis and you can work through trading these markets.</p>
<p><h3>[1:04:00 - 1:04:30] `frame_0129.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And if you have a mental flexibility, you can make the analysis and you can work through trading these markets. References are extremely important. Volume, shape, repair. Okay? Here is a perfect, perfect S&P trade. If you are prepared for the trade. The market gaps higher. The market gaps higher. And it gapped higher in A period. Trades a little higher. And in the second period, B period.</p>
<p><h3>[1:04:30 - 1:05:00] `frame_0130.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And in the second period, B period. A period. B period. Comes down. And guess what it can't do? It can't close the gap. That is your perfect daytime frame trade. Down there. Now, when you get down here, it's kind of strange. Because remember, it went up which way first? Went up in A, then it came down in B. There's a word I use.</p>
<p><h3>[1:05:00 - 1:05:30] `frame_0131.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>There's a word I use. It's called, how many people have heard it before? It's called tempo, right? Let me tell you what this looks like. If you're coming down towards that low. The tempo, the market will have trouble taking out this low. The tempo will start to slow. And it will kind of push like this. And it will kind of push again. And one of the things that you learn with cumulative experience is to feel the market. When, if the tempo is slow, you're above yesterday's high.</p>
<p><h3>[1:05:30 - 1:06:00] `frame_0132.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>When, if the tempo is slow, you're above yesterday's high. You have, I think, longer term traders that wanted to sell can sell at a higher price than they could have yesterday without a question, right? The market's coming down and the tempo is slow. Do you think the longer term sellers are there or the aggressive sellers are there? No. Now, I'll get all kind of questions. Well, Jim, explain to me again what tempo is.</p>

<p>Well, Jim, explain to me again what tempo is. You have to experience. But if you know to look for tempo, over a period of time, you will start to understand what tempo is. You're in the traffic. You know, if you're, if most of the traffic's going 67 miles an hour and you're at about 66, 67, your tempo, your flow is pretty much with the traffic, right? Now, all of a sudden, you're in and out of traffic. You're trying to get someplace. Your tempo is out of sync with the, with the traffic.</p>
<p><h3>[1:06:30 - 1:07:00] `frame_0134.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Your tempo is out of sync with the, with the traffic. That's another form of tempo, right? So, when you're coming down like this, the tempo starts to slow and all of a sudden, it goes through your mind. You recognize it. You don't have anything other than tempo to go on. You have your reference. You're watching the gap. You're trying to see if they can close the gap. They can't close the gap. That's your buying opportunity. However, if you got your mind all messed up, oh, price opened higher, went higher. Now, it's trying to sell off.</p>
<p><h3>[1:07:00 - 1:07:30] `frame_0135.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Now, it's trying to sell off. Oh, my golly. This thing could really destroy me. Now, you brought yourself to a point of indecision. You can't make the decision to get long that market. Going long this market at the right price is going to fly in the face of what's been happening for the last half hour or so, right? If you have nothing, you have no context. You don't know it's higher. You don't know you got the gap. You don't know the tempo's slow. You have no context at which to judge what's going on or another situation.</p>
<p><h3>[1:07:30 - 1:08:00] `frame_0136.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You have no context at which to judge what's going on or another situation. You're going to trade the S&Ps. The market's going to open substantially higher. You see the overnight trade is substantially higher. It would be expected when the market opens. It's the first thing you would expect traders to do would be what? Take some profit. So, the market owns substantially higher overnight. The first thing they do is they're taking profit. And if you don't understand, it's just a little profit taking.</p>

<p>And if you don't understand, it's just a little profit taking. You get sucked into profit taking. And all of a sudden, you're not going to get lower value. You can't close the gap. All you got was some profit taking. You remove some weak longs from overnight. Time, chance to get long in the market. But if all of a sudden, you're focused on that price, you saw a price. And a lot of times, when the overnight inventory is long, you open higher in the S&Ps. You may see them starting to sell from the open belt. Oh, boy. This market's really weak. Then all of a sudden, you realize, wait a minute. Tempo's slowing.</p>
<p><h3>[1:08:30 - 1:09:00] `frame_0138.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Tempo's slowing. They can't get the gap. You'll see this situation. And it usually can be a pretty good trade. The good for a daytime frame trade, now, as the market starts back up, now you start to look to see how smooth is that auction to the upside. It's a two-way auction process. Continually auction from low to high, high to low. Each auction contains within it evidence that's going to help you determine what the next results or the next auction or the following day may be.</p>
<p><h3>[1:09:00 - 1:09:30] `frame_0139.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Each auction contains within it evidence that's going to help you determine what the next results or the next auction or the following day may be. Years ago, before they changed the tax law, and I was working for Payne-Weber and in the institutional area, doctors and dentists and corporate people that wanted to have an outing and they wanted to write it off for tax purposes would have it at a nice location, and they might come along and invite a speaker. So they had a speaker. They could all get together after skiing and, you know, something and have a few beers and have a speaker.</p>
<p><h3>[1:09:30 - 1:10:00] `frame_0140.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They could all get together after skiing and, you know, something and have a few beers and have a speaker. They'd all write it off, right? They changed the tax law and made it a little more difficult. Well, anyhow, this one was in Las Vegas. Now, these guys, they probably got there the day before. So you know they're probably fairly tired. They've been out golfing in meetings and drinking all day. And now they've got to come and attend this seminar where I'm going to be the speaker that night. I'm going to talk about an inviting opportunity. So what I decided to do, it was on trading, but I decided to give the whole seminar that night,</p>
<p><h3>[1:10:00 - 1:10:30] `frame_0141.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So what I decided to do, it was on trading, but I decided to give the whole seminar that night, which I was going to keep to less than an hour, on blackjack in the market. And it's probably one of the best receptions I've ever had. Because normally what these guys come in, they come in, sign in, sit down. They've physically been there if they ever get questioned, and they're gone. No one left. And they said, we're going to talk tonight about trading and blackjack and the similarities.</p>
<p><h3>[1:10:30 - 1:11:00] `frame_0142.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>MONDAY, APRIL 12TH</blockquote>
<blockquote>ONGATION</blockquote></p>
<p>And they said, we're going to talk tonight about trading and blackjack and the similarities. And one of my first clients ever when I was in the brokerage business was a guy named Ed Thorpe. Ed Thorpe was one of, his original book was How to Beat the Dealer. Had another book, How to Beat the Market. One of these guys was a card counter, professor, University of California, Irvine campus. They finally told him that he might not want to come back to Las Vegas in there. So a pretty good idea about the blackjack and the cards and what went on. But the main theme, the main theme was in blackjack.</p>
<p><h3>[1:11:00 - 1:11:30] `frame_0143.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But the main theme, the main theme was in blackjack. Because Ed was a card counter, I visioned myself as a card counter. I don't remember ever needing a guard to take me home from Las Vegas. But I said, in card counting and in blackjack, what has been played before has an effect on the statistical outcome of the following hand, right? And assuming at this point, those, I'm so old, they played with single decks. They didn't have shoes and all of those back. But what has been played before affects the outcome of what's going, what's going to happen forward.</p>
<p><h3>[1:11:30 - 1:12:00] `frame_0144.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But what has been played before affects the outcome of what's going, what's going to happen forward. And I said, in trading and in investing, what has played out before has a lot to say about the odds and the outcome going forward. We saw the example earlier with two poor lows. Okay? I think that has a lot to say about the outcome going forward. And that is kind of what this idea of cumulative evidence about the market.</p>
<p><h3>[1:12:00 - 1:12:30] `frame_0145.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And that is kind of what this idea of cumulative evidence about the market. When the market was going up before it made its historic break, you know, a week or so ago, the structure, the cumulative evidence was saying that there was a tremendous amount of weakness in the market. Did I know it was going to happen? Did I predict it? No. But I knew that the evidence, that the underlying structure was relatively weak. Okay. Let's take a look at what we've got here. Overnight trade.</p>
<p><h3>[1:12:30 - 1:13:00] `frame_0146.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Overnight trade. Let me very briefly talk about what I do with the overnight trade. I already told you I use the overnight trade only for the reference of the high and the low. I also use it for one other thing. Was the overnight inventory long or short? That's an awful difficult concept. If the overnight inventory, if the close yesterday was at 6 and all the overnight inventory takes place above 6,</p>
<p><h3>[1:13:00 - 1:13:30] `frame_0147.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>If the overnight inventory, if the close yesterday was at 6 and all the overnight inventory takes place above 6, I come in and I say the overnight inventory is long. Now, the trouble most people have with making any sense out of that is in a simple form, the economists will tell you, well, Jim, who cares? There has to be a buyer for every seller, right? Well, it's a buyer for every seller. What do you care what the overnight inventory is?</p>
<p><h3>[1:13:30 - 1:14:00] `frame_0148.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>What do you care what the overnight inventory is? Ha! The key is there doesn't necessarily have to be a long-term buyer matched with a long-term seller. What if I have a long-term buyer matched against a short-term seller or vice versa or any combination thereof? If General Motors is a long-time frame manufacturer, right, in the business, they'd be considered long-time frame. Okay? They are then selling cars or putting cars in the hands of the dealer.</p>
<p><h2>Section 10: They are then selling cars or putting cars in the hands of</h2></p>
<p><h3>[1:14:00 - 1:14:30] `frame_0149.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They are then selling cars or putting cars in the hands of the dealer. Are the dealers, do the dealers have the same motivation as General Motors? No. What does the dealer wants to do? He's a short-term player. He wants to put a markup on it, right? He wants to put a markup on it, get it out the door. Put a markup on it, get it out the door. The dealer is very much like the local used to be on a trading floor. Trading floor. So we've got an imbalance between what the long-time frame seller wants to do and what the short-time frame buyer wants to do.</p>
<p><h3>[1:14:30 - 1:15:00] `frame_0150.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So we've got an imbalance between what the long-time frame seller wants to do and what the short-time frame buyer wants to do. And Markets in Profile, the last book I wrote, talked about this example from the housing market. When the market first started, you had a contractor that built a home, had a contract. He built a home for a buyer. That buyer was going to live in that home, right? You've got a pretty good match between the buyer and seller. Well, as the market got a little bit hotter, the contractor decided he'd build one on contract, but maybe he'll do three or four specs to go along with it, right?</p>
<p><h3>[1:15:00 - 1:15:30] `frame_0151.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>

<p>Well, as the market got a little bit hotter, the contractor decided he'd build one on contract, but maybe he'll do three or four specs to go along with it, right? All of a sudden, you've got the buyer, instead of buying a home that they're going to live in, well, maybe they start up, maybe they'll buy a second home. So we found near the top of the market, I don't remember the exact number, it was like 38% of the people had a second home. Then you had other people that started to talk about flipping the homes, right? And we went to this woman down in Naples and had 50 homes. Well, you kind of get an idea of the imbalance that can exist between different time frames and different motivations.</p>
<p><h3>[1:15:30 - 1:16:00] `frame_0152.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Well, you kind of get an idea of the imbalance that can exist between different time frames and different motivations. When you look, let's say that the overnight inventory in a market is higher. The overnight inventory may represent only 10% to 15% of the same type of volume that would take place during the day. So if the market's up overnight, I know the high and the low, and if it's up overnight, I'm going to make an assumption that more than likely, I've got the inventory in relatively weak hands overnight.</p>
<p><h3>[1:16:00 - 1:16:30] `frame_0153.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I've got the inventory in relatively weak hands overnight. It doesn't have to happen. But I kind of start and I want to know that. So I will take a look, I will take a look at that. I will also use the overnight market in order to place trades. I don't very often trade the overnight market, but that doesn't mean that I won't put an order to buy something at some level that I want to buy it if the trade's down there in the overnight market.</p>
<p><h3>[1:16:30 - 1:17:00] `frame_0154.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>that I want to buy it if the trade's down there in the overnight market. Earlier, we talked about a pullback low or some anomaly in the marketplace. Here was kind of an anomaly in the marketplace. Thought it might come back to. I had an order in to buy at this level overnight. And it got down to that level. Do I necessarily recommend it? No. But I had a reason for wanting to be in this market. And I said, okay, where might I put an order?</p>
<p><h3>[1:17:00 - 1:17:30] `frame_0155.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And I said, okay, where might I put an order? This corresponds to about half back. It corresponds to this anomaly. And you can see the market got it with just a couple of ticks below that. So from time to time, I will use that in order to get the markets that I want. But I also will say, if in fact the market can pull back too much overnight, if the market was really strong, it probably couldn't pull back that much. So again, I will gain information from that.</p>

<p>So again, I will gain information from that. Remember, it's nuances. It's nuances. Okay? Let's just kind of see where we are. Let's move forward on here. Thursday in here, built higher value. Remember, we did the buy overnight. Higher with the trend. Markets really having trouble going higher. Kind of going higher on vapors. The low was early.</p>
<p><h3>[1:18:00 - 1:18:30] `frame_0157.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The low was early. We came down and took it out. Did the point of control migrate higher? It wasn't able to migrate higher. It's a sign that there really isn't a lot of strength in the market. Now, remember, we looked at this base. Finally, we got down below this base. First time we got rejected. But it's not a healthy structure. Higher value. It's moving higher with the trend. Fair to elongate.</p>
<p><h3>[1:18:30 - 1:19:00] `frame_0158.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Why didn't it elongate? Okay? Because more than likely, it's going higher, higher value. But what's stopping it from elongating? What is stopping the point of control from migrating higher? More than likely, it's a longer time frame, being very patient, saying, you bought some. You bought some more. Remember my example of the guy from one of the graining companies in Minneapolis? Come on the grain floor. You bought some.</p>
<p><h3>[1:19:00 - 1:19:30] `frame_0159.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You bought some. It's a nuance. And those nuances are very important in the market. It's very, the market, you start to get a feeling that the market is very, very heavy. You get a feeling it's running on vapors. You get a feeling that the risk, the risk is getting to be excessive. That is a very poor low, right? We saw a low. We could have a low with five ticks. We could have a low with one tick. Now, the second tick off of the low is three wide.</p>

<p>Now, the second tick off of the low is three wide. I wouldn't want to go home. I wouldn't want to go home long this market for anything. If something goes wrong, some anxiety event, it's not going to be able to support it very well. The market's getting very heavy. Let's take a look at what's coming up. The market down there is heavy, but we saw this slide before, right? Even though it looked heavy, was it trading on its own?</p>
<p><h3>[1:20:00 - 1:20:30] `frame_0161.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Even though it looked heavy, was it trading on its own? It wasn't trading on its own. Guess what? When a market's not trading on its own, I don't want to be involved in the market. The risk is too great. There's just too much uncertainty. Okay? Okay, Friday, April 16th, poor high indicates that a market has gotten too long. Remember, early on, I made the point.</p>
<p><h3>[1:20:30 - 1:21:00] `frame_0162.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Remember, early on, I made the point. We started off and we talked very simply about buying tails and selling tails, right? And I said at that point, careful, it's more complex than that. I also know that when people first hear about buying tails and selling tails, they want to run out and they want to look for opportunities where they can buy with a buying tail and they can sell with a selling tail. They haven't understood the complexity of it. And I did make you a promise.</p>
<p><h3>[1:21:00 - 1:21:30] `frame_0163.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And I did make you a promise. I made you a promise that as we got through this, it would be more complex and you would start to understand the difficulty. You would start to understand why somebody in one of the chat rooms said, oh, this is just, it's just too ambiguous. It's just too intense. It's not for me. And that's right. It's not for a lot of people. When you get the complexity up here, a poor high, in one sense, we'd say a poor high is indication that the market is not what?</p>
<p><h3>[1:21:30 - 1:22:00] `frame_0164.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>When you get the complexity up here, a poor high, in one sense, we'd say a poor high is indication that the market is not what? It's not completed, right? So in one sense, we say, oh, we're going higher. The market's not completed. But in another sense, and you have to take this in context, if this happens early in a rally or if it happens very late in a rally or a trend, now as it happens later and later, if a market gets too long, those that are too long get very, very nervous, just like those that are too short get very nervous.</p>

<p>now as it happens later and later, if a market gets too long, those that are too long get very, very nervous, just like those that are too short get very nervous. So if they get too long and all of a sudden start to get a sense that they're caught, they're going to be selling every high. So you get up here, poor highs can also indicate a market has gotten too long. Very confusing, right? You say, well, wait a minute. In one sense, it says the market's not completed. It may be, you may have a situation where the market is not completed for one time frame, but it is completed for another time frame.</p>
<p><h2>Section 11: It may be, you may have a situation where the market is not</h2></p>
<p><h3>[1:22:30 - 1:23:00] `frame_0166.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It may be, you may have a situation where the market is not completed for one time frame, but it is completed for another time frame. So this may tell us that a next longer time frame, we're not completed. But for the shorter time, the market is too long. Then you combine that, the poor high, you combine that with the point of control not moving higher, and you start to get more and more evidence that you've got a market that is too long. Now, traders will continue to do what works until it doesn't work anymore. Now, traders will continue to do what works until it is too long. Buying brakes, they aren't getting much for it.</p>
<p><h3>[1:23:00 - 1:23:30] `frame_0167.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Start thinking the diffusion model. Okay? When you look at a brake like this, up there, all of a sudden, you've got some people selling into the rally. More than likely, who are they? They're the innovators, right? They're the innovators. Now, the market starts to come down. Another concept I want you to think about. This gets me thinking because you say, well, it didn't pull back very far. But you've got a whole lot of longs in there. Think drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.</p>
<p><h3>[1:23:30 - 1:24:00] `frame_0168.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Think drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. The longer, if you're holding long positions, the longer the market drips on you, the longer you don't get the satisfaction of rallying, the more uncomfortable you get with your long position, the more anxious you become to sell it. So now you're selling on the high, you're selling on the high here. Even though, remember, you may have a situation where the innovators are doing what? Selling. Some early longs are selling.</p>

<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>2™° HALF FRIDAY, APRIL 16'": LIQUIDATION</blockquote></p>
<p>Some early longs are selling. But the momentum traders are still doing buying every what? Buying every break, right? So see the dynamics in here. A lot of the momentum traders, now I'm thinking, they'll do what works until it doesn't work anymore. So they're buying every break. They're getting less and less for it. The innovators, or those that are longer term, a little long, they're going, you bought some, you bought some more. The example that I like to use, and I don't know if this will show up from the video,</p>
<p><h3>[1:24:30 - 1:25:00] `frame_0170.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The example that I like to use, and I don't know if this will show up from the video, but I saw somebody do this example years ago. So if you take a coin and you spend that coin, you get less and less and less and less and less each time. So if you think about that, the buyers are buying every break. They're getting less and less each time. And finally, the last time, they get nothing, right? So they buy, and then they have to turn around and sell immediately.</p>
<p><h3>[1:25:00 - 1:25:30] `frame_0171.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So they buy, and then they have to turn around and sell immediately. It's a process. Highs and lows are made via a process. So now they were selling up here. We got another day that we're selling at the highs again. Value here is going to be what? Value is going to be lowered. Price and value are going to be lowered. Remember, early on, we said this was the top of a spike earlier. We got into the spike a little bit the previous day. We're back down into the spike, below the spike. We broke support.</p>
<p><h3>[1:25:30 - 1:26:00] `frame_0172.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Okay? That's kind of a process that goes on. Okay. So let's move forward and see what we're looking at. So the second half of, you see the second half of Friday take place, and you get more of a liquidating break. You can see the culmination of that process, right? You see the process. You saw it in profile. You saw the process.</p>
<p><h3>[1:26:00 - 1:26:30] `frame_0173.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You saw the process. You saw the cumulative evidence. You were getting less and less each time as the momentum players were coming in. We saw evidence that we saw selling by the innovators. We saw the momentum players still buying every break. And finally, it all comes apart. A nuance. Usually on a big, meaningful break, about, if you've done your references right,</p>

<p>Usually on a big, meaningful break, about, if you've done your references right, it usually takes about three good, solid references to contain a meaningful break in the marketplace. So what we've tried to do, we've tried to walk through some examples that are relatively current, tried to give you a feeling of a relatively complicated process, tried to give you a feeling of where you saw. Clearly, you were seeing conflicting information in here, but yet you saw the final outcome on a break moving pretty sharply.</p>
<p><h3>[1:27:00 - 1:27:30] `frame_0175.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>but yet you saw the final outcome on a break moving pretty sharply. Odds-based trading. You're continually trying to assess the odds. The poor underlying structure coming into Friday had increased the odds against the longs, right? It didn't predict the break. Okay. It didn't predict the break. The poor structure and what was going on. But it certainly increased the odds that the conditions were right for something like that to happen.</p>
<p><h3>[1:27:30 - 1:28:00] `frame_0176.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We very often will see that a daytime frame auction struggling to trade higher. There's information in that. Structure weakens. Vime declines. However, price doesn't decline. But the odds have changed. The odds have changed. So sometimes, even if price doesn't indicate the change, the weakening structure, the lower volume, and all those things will indicate that the odds are changing. We as human beings are not well programmed to think in terms of odds.</p>
<p><h3>[1:28:00 - 1:28:30] `frame_0177.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We as human beings are not well programmed to think in terms of odds. It's just not, from all the research I've read, we are just not naturally programmed to be odds-based thinkers. We take exceptional risks that we never think, I mean, we drive cars on ice, and I live out where everybody's got a four-wheel drive vehicle, and they know that a four-wheel drive vehicle, you can drive any place on snow and ice, right? And of course, you go by and see them up down, but we're upside down in the road all the time. We're just not good at odds-based trading, and what I'm trying to get you to think about is, as you transition, think about being an odds-based trader.</p>

<p>We're just not good at odds-based trading, and what I'm trying to get you to think about is, as you transition, think about being an odds-based trader. Think about cumulative evidence, and how do we get to make intelligent trades? How do we control our risk? Remember, we can control risk. We can't control return. What I would suggest that you do from here is take this information. We provided you with a workbook.</p>
<p><h3>[1:29:00 - 1:29:30] `frame_0179.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We provided you with a workbook. On a few places in the workbook, I incorporated some things that I thought were relatively important, left space for you to take your own notes, and hopefully we added additional information today. It will not come easy, I promise you. I will think that the odds are very good if you stick with it. You will benefit tremendously from this. And as Julia said early on, you will probably never look at the market twice the same way you used to.</p>
<p><h3>[1:29:30 - 1:30:00] `frame_0180.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And as Julia said early on, you will probably never look at the market twice the same way you used to. You'll look at it entirely different than you ever thought about looking at it. You probably never thought about excess and balance in the same framework. Hopefully, what we've done is given you a base from which to begin a whole new way to look, understand markets, and to advance your trading career.</p>
<p><h3>[1:30:00 - 1:30:30] `frame_0181.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>and to advance your trading career. And most of the people we deal with are already professional traders, or their goal is to become serious professional traders. I'd like to thank a few people. Window Trader, owned by Terry Lieberman, provided a lot of the charts. Window Trader and CQG. CQG is the quote vendor I use, along with Window Trader. Also, we're very instrumental in providing us with a lot of the charts and the graphs that we use today.</p>
<p><h3>[1:30:30 - 1:31:00] `frame_0182.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Also, we're very instrumental in providing us with a lot of the charts and the graphs that we use today. I really want to thank you very, very much for coming out and spending this time, and have a great trading going forward. Thanks. Thank you.
