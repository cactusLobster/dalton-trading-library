<h1>DVD 4 — Raw SRT</h1>
<pre>1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.600
We said we're going to go back and refer again to the diffusion model.

2
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.520
And what you want to think about, here's the excess low on the 5th of February.

3
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.540
And this would have been, you know, on the S&Ps.

4
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.860
Now review.

5
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.240
Who made that low?

6
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.220
When you think of diffusion model, who caused the low?

7
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.560
Laggard what?

8
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.540
Laggard shorts.

9
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.420
As the other laggard, laggard longs, right?

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.820
The last longs, laggard longs capitulated, sold into it.

11
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.680
The ones that hadn't gone out, hanging on to the very end by their fingernails.

12
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.200
Those that hadn't shorted, the laggard shorts.

13
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.660
And then they were met by whom at the very bottom?

14
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.700
The innovators.

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.500
I don't know if we've got this on the next slide.

16
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.060
We'll see in a minute.

17
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:23.080
This was, not only does the excess show here, the excess shows also very, very well on the

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.540
day timeframe profile.

19
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.880
Matter of fact, it was a very expensive operation because I was leaving Chicago that day when

20
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.460
that happened.

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.620
I was just checking out of the hotel and it broke and left the excess.

22
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.180
And of course, I wasn't going to do it on the plane.

23
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.060
But I did see this developing.

24
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.580
So the first thing is, two sets of laggards.

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.780
The laggard's long.

26
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.760
Those that hadn't gotten out, finally capitulated down here.

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.980
Then you get those that hadn't shorted, that finally threw in the towel and shorted.

28
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.960
And they were met by the innovator.

29
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.160
And it was a meaningful excess.

30
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.100
And you can look at that and you can see how easy it is to identify that excess.

31
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.920
Now, remember, this market has come down a long way.

32
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.160
I think that was something in the order of 7 or 8% decline, if I remember right.

33
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.500
So what have traders and what have investors been seeing the whole way down?

34
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.020
Lower prices, lower prices, lower prices, right?

35
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.180
The best trade flies in the face of what?

36
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.660
The most recent market activity.

37
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.220
And while it looks pretty clear right now, boy, it's a tough trade at the time that it's

38
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.600
happening.

39
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.420
When you start to think about the emotions, how much you second guess yourself.

40
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.180
But if you can get your emotions control and you look and say, wait a minute, I understand

41
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.000
excess.

42
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.040
Then the market started back up.

43
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.340
Okay.

44
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.680
This, what is this area right here?

45
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.440
This would be what?

46
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.680
Balance, right?

47
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.200
So I have a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 day balance.

48
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.920
The breakout of balance.

49
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.540
I have a term.

50
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.060
I call it clean or unclean.

51
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.880
A clean balance means that the next balance is cleanly above the lower balance.

52
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.720
Okay.

53
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.180
Is the next balance cleanly above the lower balance?

54
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.580
I said at least earlier, you ought to be able to put your finger or pencil mark between them.

55
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.860
I can put my car between it.

56
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.660
Is the auction young or old?

57
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.260
Young.

58
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.400
The auction is young.

59
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.280
Now we balance again.

60
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.400
Even on the balance, what did we get?

61
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.140
Excess.

62
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.740
We got excess, right?

63
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.740
So now, then we balance here, a little balance.

64
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.340
But we're still, then we get another breakout, young or old?

65
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.420
Yeah.

66
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.900
Okay.

67
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.240
If you get yourself tied up with price, oh my, this is too high.

68
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320
I'm not buying it here.

69
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.220
You're going to have a terrible time and you're going to end up going the wrong way.

70
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.800
If you look in here and you say, wait a minute, whether this auction is any good, whether it's

71
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.720
lasting for a long period of time, I'm a trader.

72
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.060
If I'm a trader, I'm not an economist.

73
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.300
If I'm a trader, I'm looking at market generated information.

74
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.100
And the market generated information is clearly going where?

75
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.220
It's clearly going higher.

76
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.520
I can see it by drawing a trend line.

77
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.640
I can see it by the balances.

78
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.980
We have what we call value area trends where the value keeps going higher.

79
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.380
So again, one type of trading, one type of trading in here, right?

80
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.220
Another type of trading in here.

81
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.960
Go with trades here.

82
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.600
Go with trades here.

83
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.940
That's the process that goes on.

84
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.260
But it started right here with the excess on February 5th.

85
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.960
Now the other day when the market broke, it came all the way down to right here.

86
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.640
What broke that thousand?

87
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.260
What balanced or brought that thing back in the line?

88
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.140
Was this excess low from February 5th?

89
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.040
Those references are important.

90
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.960
When things like that take place, you have to be prepared.

91
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.980
You have to know what to go look at very quickly.

92
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.920
I wish I'd have been more prepared.

93
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.700
I wasn't prepared and didn't mentally get it together fast enough.

94
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.720
Okay.

95
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.620
Let's take a look.

96
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.480
Following excess, you can begin to think about strategy and tactics rather than coming each day with a blank tablet.

97
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.080
Okay.

98
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.320
Once I have excess, if I have excess and the excess is on the row, I start to think about my trading strategy being what?

99
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.080
Buying breaks, selling rallies, right?

100
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.140
Buying breaks, selling rallies.

101
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.060
Going with the trend.

102
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.540
Too many traders trade against the trend.

103
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.280
And particularly they say, well, the market's been going down for months.

104
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.620
We only got a few days going up.

105
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.680
But remember what excess does.

106
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.760
Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction.

107
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.140
When we went down to the February 5th low, it certainly wasn't a scalper excess, right?

108
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.820
It certainly wasn't a daytime frame excess.

109
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.740
And if it's down 7% or 8%, it's not going to be short-term excess because that's only 3 to 5 days.

110
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.200
So at a minimum, what was my excess on the 5th of February?

111
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.860
Intermediate-term excess at a minimum, right?

112
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.920
So the longer the time frame the excess is for, the more significant it is.

113
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.100
So my excess on February 6th was very significant down there.

114
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:45.300
And that's why the importance of making that identification, writing that down, will help get you in the right mental frame of mind and open your imagination.

115
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.800
Wait a minute.

116
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.700
That was intermediate-term excess.

117
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.820
This could be a pretty significant auction to the upside.

118
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.020
That starts to get you back in touch with what's going on in the market.

119
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.980
All right.

120
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.680
Field of vision.

121
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.580
When you put it all together, what you really have is the field of vision.

122
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.060
This is what, this is the name of the video.

123
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.240
This is where we've been going for.

124
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:25.140
And as you spend the required time to put all the pieces together, when you get all said and done, you're going to look very much, you're going to play field hockey very much like Julia's friend, Megan.

125
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.700
You're going to see the field of vision.

126
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.120
You're going to be able to shoot straight when you go for the gold.

127
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.140
Okay?

128
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.140
Talk a little bit about volume.

129
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:45.600
The majority of studies that you will read will tell you that volume doesn't matter.

130
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.080
What that really means is that they haven't figured out how to use volume yet.

131
00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:01.860
When people do research, what they tend to do to go to the University of Chicago, I think it's called CRISPR, Center for Research and Security Prices,

132
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.880
and they buy these streams of data that go back for many years.

133
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.600
These streams of data are only price data.

134
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.560
There's no context on the data.

135
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.640
They don't know if the price was made on old business or new business.

136
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.340
Old business would be short covering or old business would be long liquidation.

137
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.100
New business would be new money coming in the market or new shorts being set in the market.

138
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.300
They have no, there's no context.

139
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.960
They don't know if the price was made on high volume or low volume.

140
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.180
They treat all prices as equal.

141
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:42.660
Anybody in any kind of business intuitively knows that all prices are not equal.

142
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.380
No two opportunities are the same.

143
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.980
So they take this data.

144
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.640
They can't intuitively resist these scientists that should be smart.

145
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:59.480
And we're talking literally people from the atomic energy research people, you know, out west.

146
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:06.000
Los Alamos truly scientists come out of there, been hired by these firms to do this research,

147
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.840
and they make the same basic mistake.

148
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.020
They start with data that's not reliable, but they can't resist.

149
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.980
How can I not work with 40 years of data, right?

150
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.220
But there's no context.

151
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.000
It's meaning.

152
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.280
So volume, there's studies come out and tell you volume doesn't matter.

153
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:21.800
Okay?

154
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.900
Volume doesn't matter.

155
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.400
Anybody in business, if you raise your price and your volume drops off, you know it matters.

156
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.280
Does that mean that it's going to go down and correct immediately?

157
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:30.860
No.

158
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.960
But you certainly have to monitor it and you have to make adjustments.

159
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.820
Now, price advertises opportunity, time regulates opportunity, and volume measures the success

160
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.800
or failure of the advertised opportunity.

161
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.580
But let's put some context around volume.

162
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.840
Volume is like anything else.

163
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.480
If, for example, let's move forward just a little bit here.

164
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.760
Volume in a balanced area is not nearly as important.

165
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:08.220
So if I'm in a trading area, I'm in a four-day or five-day trading range, the market is fairly

166
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.020
well balanced.

167
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.840
Volume is relatively insignificant because all the market's doing, it's found a place where

168
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.400
two-sided trade can take place.

169
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.560
The market's just kind of going back and forth on a balancing area.

170
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.800
And volume isn't, it's not unimportant.

171
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.520
Okay?

172
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.140
If you have an up-day or down-day with significantly light or low volume, I will take it into account

173
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.120
and I do track it.

174
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:40.160
But where volume is really important is when I break out, if I break out of this four-day

175
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.320
balance to the upside.

176
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.100
Okay?

177
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.080
I'm getting away.

178
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.240
So I'll have a Ferris Price to do business for four days just as I have a Ferris Price

179
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.520
to do business for a single day.

180
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:49.720
Right?

181
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:56.380
So in order to get away from the Ferris Price to do business, I'm going to need volume.

182
00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:02.800
If I don't have volume, Ferris Price to do business is going to act very much like a magnet

183
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.980
and pull price back to it.

184
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.360
So in order to get away from it, I'm going to need volume.

185
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.620
And what I want to see if I break out of an area, I want to see that higher prices begin

186
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.800
to bring in more volume.

187
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.400
Or if it's going the other way, I want to see that it's bringing in even less volume.

188
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.700
So volume in breakouts from balance, far more important than the volume that takes place

189
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.220
within a balanced area.

190
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.660
Now, that all sounds nice, but let's be honest.

191
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:43.860
We went through a period when the market went up to new highs before it made this historic

192
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.140
break a few days to go.

193
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.860
It took it down 1,000 points, and volume was terrible on the upside.

194
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.620
So everybody said, well, Jim, what about this volume?

195
00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.700
Well, all I can say at the point is volume wasn't high, but the market kept going up.

196
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.540
Okay.

197
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.520
And why did the market keep going up?

198
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.480
The momentum traders were there.

199
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.840
Momentum traders are generally non-thinking traders.

200
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.580
Whatever it is, they're going to go with it.

201
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.080
They're like the people at the pari-mutual board that we showed before.

202
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.920
You know, if you can bet on the race until it's over, you just keep throwing your money

203
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.940
at it, even if the risk return doesn't make sense.

204
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.700
You just keep going with the momentum.

205
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:34.740
Then you've got, and I was listening one day to one of the guys on CNBC, and they were talking

206
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.040
to him.

207
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.480
He's leaning.

208
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.280
He's got this picture of him leaning against the door for him, and he said, I really don't

209
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.400
like the market in here.

210
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.880
We don't like the market, but you know, everybody is, it's going up, so we're not going to sell.

211
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.240
We don't want to sell right now.

212
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.900
Nobody wants to sell first.

213
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.940
Nobody wants to sell first.

214
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.000
So then his comment was, he said, but we're leaning, we're leaning in the door frame so

215
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.400
we can be the first out if this thing breaks.

216
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.040
Now, do you think he was the only one leaning in the door frame?

217
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.080
He wasn't the only one leaning in the door frame.

218
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.220
And people said, well, how could the market go down that far?

219
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.660
Because they were all leaning, in my opinion, the structure, the volume underneath it was

220
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.240
not supportive of what happened.

221
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.480
They're all leaning in the door frame, and they're all trying to get out.

222
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.380
You know, it's like a fire get out at the same time.

223
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.940
So we were out of line volume-wise for a long period of time.

224
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.180
And a lot of people that, you know, listen to what I say and what I write, were having

225
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.920
some serious questions about this and say, it's not a bank.

226
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.040
But at the same time, people that read, I'm still a realist.

227
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.120
If I got a three-day balance, what am I going to do, guys?

228
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.400
I'm going with a breakout from the three-day balance, right?

229
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.380
I will understand that my structure underneath isn't right.

230
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.100
I will have the stops.

231
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.160
I will be protective.

232
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.480
But I'm not going to sit there and fight the trend just because the volume isn't there.

233
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:07.020
But I do know, I do know that the potential for something to go very, very wrong is building

234
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.940
in that market.

235
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.540
And that's exactly what happened.

236
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:16.280
It's, and it's so many of the people here that are our guests today have read some of

237
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.580
these things.

238
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:22.060
So they know that this isn't something that was just kind of dreamed up after the fact.

239
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.440
Now, and some of my longer-term clients took good use of it because they were structured

240
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.080
correctly in their longer-term portfolios.

241
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:38.420
So volume, also, when you're going up on low volume, even though you're going higher, what

242
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.520
is happening to the odds, the odds of being long?

243
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.720
You're still going higher.

244
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.480
But your odds are doing what?

245
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.220
Are they increasing?

246
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.660
The odds of being successful.

247
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.760
Increasing or decreasing?

248
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.820
They're decreasing.

249
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.180
They're going against you, right?

250
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.780
You're like you're at the tote board and you're down to the point where you're going to get

251
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.360
a 201 payoff for $2.

252
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.800
The risk-reward doesn't make any sense.

253
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:10.080
Because I'm always taken about the comment that Prince made when he was asked at Citibank,

254
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.620
why didn't they get out of some of this toxic stuff?

255
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.780
Everybody remember what his answer was?

256
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.660
He said, well, everybody was still dancing.

257
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.300
Everybody was still dancing.

258
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.560
In other words, they claimed they saw the risk, but they didn't get out because everybody

259
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.400
was still dancing.

260
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.880
So they were leaning against the doorframe so they could get out, right?

261
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.240
Those things happen.

262
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.560
That's where bubbles come from.

263
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.380
That's where excesses come from in the market.

264
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.580
Let me put it in the same kind of terms that I talked about yesterday.

265
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.860
I said I ran an institutional trading desk.

266
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.780
Let's talk about the mentality of the longer-term traders.

267
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.520
And those were a lot of our customers.

268
00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:05.340
Let's say that you are the head trading manager or senior portfolio manager for a very large fund.

269
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.720
They'll all deny this probably, but markets going up.

270
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.520
And all of a sudden, you are the first one out of the market.

271
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.060
Okay?

272
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.240
And let's say you're absolutely right.

273
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.160
You're one out, two, three, and four are right behind you, and you really look great.

274
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.500
But so quickly, you get lost within the crowd.

275
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.740
You don't get any special credit for being the first one, right?

276
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.560
Because everybody's selling.

277
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.160
You may have been first, but everybody's selling.

278
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.860
You don't get any special credit.

279
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.240
Now, let's say you're the first one to sell and nobody else sells.

280
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.800
Now, do you get any special recognition?

281
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.520
You're the only one that sold.

282
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.860
Nobody else did.

283
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.220
You're out there on a limb by yourself.

284
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.600
And the example I gave yesterday, you probably worked for a suit.

285
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.040
I was one of those suits.

286
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.560
I have my traders out here.

287
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.260
I'm a trading desk.

288
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.860
And we did business with institutions.

289
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.300
You know, but I know how you think.

290
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.220
You say, well, why in the world would you sell that?

291
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.100
Nobody else was selling.

292
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.020
Typical response that you might expect.

293
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.240
So why?

294
00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.320
Why should they take that chance?

295
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.440
Because actually, by being right, for the one time they're right, if they're wrong, their job may be at stake.

296
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:32.880
So it is very understandable to me that these markets can go to extremes without people getting out of the market.

297
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.320
Because nobody wants to be first and take that risk.

298
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.140
There is actually less risk in the institutional business, the big money business.

299
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:48.280
There's less risk in being with the crowd and having relative performance than there is being against the crowd.

300
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:55.300
Now, we said the money, the guy that made all the money on the mortgage problem with the mortgage area was Paulson.

301
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.980
Did he work for a large institution?

302
00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:57.580
No.

303
00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.220
Ran his own hedge fund, right?

304
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.080
Who did he report to?

305
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.200
He reported to himself.

306
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.320
He had the money that he had in, he had locked up.

307
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.160
He had letters that had the money locked up.

308
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.020
Guess what?

309
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.180
And when you read the big short, how many remember, how early was he on the trade?

310
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.400
He was early.

311
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.420
He was two years early on a lot of it, right?

312
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.920
Two years early.

313
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:28.400
Well, now, if you worked in an institution and you're two years early, I don't know what institution you're going to be working for by the time what you were playing for actually happened.

314
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.460
So understanding those dynamics are very important within the marketplace.

315
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.740
Because a lot of times people say, well, how in the world could that happen?

316
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.000
It's understanding the behavior.

317
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.000
Once we got the breakout the other day, what happened to volume?

318
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.700
I think they reported one day on the break we had record volume.

319
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.360
Well, they were all standing in the door trying to get out.

320
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.200
Okay.

321
00:18:52.420 --> 00:19:01.940
Again, we can't cover it all today and all in one video, but we can at least give you some understanding of the dynamics of what makes up the market.

322
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:09.320
Because we're talking about market understanding, we're talking about logic, and we're talking about self-understanding.

323
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.080
So we've got market understanding, market logic, self-understanding.

324
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:21.600
All of these things are important in order to get a holistic view of what trading is about and start to put together the good trades.

325
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.440
Okay.

326
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.140
And then we're also looking if we're looking at something.

327
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.580
We put a trade on, and once we put the trade on, we do what?

328
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.940
Monitor for continuation.

329
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.880
So let's say I'm going long the market.

330
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.640
Let's say the market starts with short coverage.

331
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:43.480
Okay.

332
00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.000
Old business or new business?

333
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.280
It's old business.

334
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:47.580
Okay.

335
00:19:47.580 --> 00:20:00.520
The chances of old business driving the market higher are reduced, even though we looked at an earlier example with a 10-year bond was at historic rates or historic short interest.

336
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.840
That did drive the market considerably higher.

337
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.720
It will happen.

338
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.980
But generally speaking, old business isn't going to take it as high as a combination of old business and new business.

339
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:19.160
So if we're monitoring for continuation, we would look and we'd say if it's old business going up, we kind of get the P formation.

340
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.740
It doesn't mean it's over.

341
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:21.480
Okay.

342
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:34.280
If we're monitoring for continuation, the healthiest profiles are going to get elongation because the market's doing a good job of facilitating trade higher and higher.

343
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:42.160
The point of control either does or doesn't migrate in the direction of price.

344
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.280
So if we're getting a good breakout to the upside, for example, we're going to have a combination of new business and old business.

345
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.040
We're going to get elongation and we're going to get a point of control that migrates higher.

346
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.580
If my breakout or monitor for continuation, it's not very good to the upside.

347
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.920
I've got old business versus new business.

348
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.940
I don't get elongation and my point of control doesn't migrate higher.

349
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.780
Remember early on we showed a place where price was going lower.

350
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.680
The point of control did not migrate lower.

351
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.860
We had almost a 45 degree angle and we saw a recovery of a big break late in the afternoon.

352
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.380
So you're trying to put these things together in order to understand the dynamics.

353
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.380
Okay.

354
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.200
Volume and attempted direction.

355
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:42.560
When you look at volume, you have to know what was the market trying to do today.

356
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.720
Volume is not relevant if you don't know what the market was trying to do.

357
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:57.440
So if the market opens in the middle, goes up, goes down, goes up, goes down, and you don't have any clear attempted direction, you don't know what the market was trying to do.

358
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.840
Volume is not relevant.

359
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.800
Volume is only relevant on those days when you know what the market was trying to do.

360
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:19.140
So if I know the market was trying to go higher, my question then becomes, what was the market trying to do and how good a job did it do of what it was attempting to do.

361
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.860
So if I open on the low, it's trying to go higher.

362
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:30.900
And if it's really good, I'm going to get increasing volume, I'm going to get elongation, and I'm going to just have a nice healthy market.

363
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:38.800
So if it opens on the low, trying to go higher, and volume diminishes, it's not a healthy day.

364
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:44.640
So without knowing attempted direction, volume will terribly, terribly mislead you.

365
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.220
So in here, volume auctions in both directions doesn't mean much.

366
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.200
Over here, opens an auction up.

367
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.320
We have a pretty clear indication of what it was trying to do.

368
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.920
Volume is much more meaningful on this particular day.

369
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.000
Okay?

370
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.440
Trade location can impact volume.

371
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.680
This is a big one.

372
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.560
What happens many times, we talked earlier, we came across a major reference.

373
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.000
Up here.

374
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.660
When a market comes to a major reference point, you're going up, you're going up, you're at a major reference point.

375
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.540
And we had this example work very, very well yesterday.

376
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.400
And I said, from a trading standpoint, if I've got a market going up to a major reference,

377
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.600
I am going to exit the trade on this side of the reference.

378
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:46.860
I will put the trade back on if it's accepted on the other side of the reference.

379
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.620
So let's say I have a five-month trading high.

380
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.640
So I have a five-month bracket trading range.

381
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.260
I go up there.

382
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.160
I'm going to take the long off on this side.

383
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.460
That is my high-risk area right there.

384
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.700
We saw one yesterday.

385
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.100
It didn't make it.

386
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.700
I think a lot of people thought we were going through.

387
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.160
It didn't make it.

388
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.120
The longer it took, it didn't make it.

389
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:13.580
As the day went on, we started to break away from it to the downside pretty quickly.

390
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.500
That is the high-risk area.

391
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.800
I'd rather, I have less risk by coming out at a lower price, reestablishing it once it's cleared,

392
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.340
the top of the range, and reestablishing the trade.

393
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.760
That's what professional traders do.

394
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.800
That's the high-risk area.

395
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:38.580
Now, when you're coming up to that very key reference point, it's got to usually be a very key reference point.

396
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.100
What you may see is volume, you may see volume diminishing.

397
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.660
We had another example yesterday where we saw volume diminish up there.

398
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.700
It got very fat.

399
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.620
We saw it diminish.

400
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.340
And then, just before the market closed, we saw a breakout to the upside.

401
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.040
Well, you say, well, Jim, well, wait a minute.

402
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.640
The volume was really low.

403
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.700
Well, the nuance was, and we said earlier nuance is important.

404
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.920
The nuance was that it was up near a significant reference.

405
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.500
Longer, smarter term traders would rather take it off on this side.

406
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.000
They would rather reestablish their long positions on the other side.

407
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.260
So, you could say, well, wait a minute.

408
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.600
We're at the bracket extreme and volume dried up.

409
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.680
Not necessarily negative.

410
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.200
You've got to relate it to where it was in the trade location.

411
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.440
And understand, it would be very logical.

412
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:39.380
If I come up here trying to take this out, it would be very logical I come out at this side, even though this one went through.

413
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.080
But it was just to give an example.

414
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.840
Take it off at a major reference.

415
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.500
Put it back on if it breaks out on the other side.

416
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.460
Okay.

417
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:46.540
Okay.

418
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:55.000
When I'm trading, there's a couple different places I can get volume.

419
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.180
If I'm trading currencies, the only volume that I'm aware of, Paul, are you still trading currencies?

420
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.500
Yeah.

421
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.140
Okay.

422
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.500
Where do you get volume from?

423
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:08.900
CME.

424
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.880
So, you're using futures volume.

425
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.000
CME.

426
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.320
That's the only volume you have available to you, right?

427
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:13.460
Yes.

428
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:25.000
So, if you're trading futures in, say, currencies or cash bonds or something like that, the only place you're going to get the real volume is from the futures volume.

429
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.860
My rule is I always go to best source.

430
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.420
And the best source, in that case, may be the futures.

431
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:47.180
If, in fact, I'm trading stocks, I go to the New York Stock Exchange and I use the composite volume from the New York Stock Exchange because I find that is a better source than is the futures volume.

432
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.680
So, my basic rule is go where I can get the best source volume.

433
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:52.940
Okay.

434
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.860
And then I look at it on a relative basis.

435
00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.400
Now, and here's what I do on my volume if I'm trading, for example, S&Ps.

436
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.900
I take, this is B period.

437
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.960
Let's say that's the opening.

438
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.460
I look in the first period.

439
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:14.580
I traded 650,000 contracts, 935, a billion three.

440
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.860
I'm looking.

441
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.980
I just track it.

442
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:22.380
I'm not totally up to date, but I just track it throughout the day.

443
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.240
I look at what the total is.

444
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.100
So, I always have some idea of what the volume is doing.

445
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.800
I know what it's doing for the period.

446
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.620
I know what it's doing throughout the day.

447
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.340
I know what it's doing total.

448
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:47.940
But I'm using New York Stock Exchange composite volume, which, if I understand it correctly, is all the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the volume from as many sources as they can pull it.

449
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.880
This is my best source.

450
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.380
So, again, if I don't have anything else, I'll use futures.

451
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.560
But I do not use futures volume when trading the S&Ps.

452
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.100
This is a better source, and it's more reliable.

453
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:00.940
Okay?

454
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.280
Preparing to trade.

455
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.040
We heard this before, right?

456
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:14.340
Literally all performance literature recognizes the connection between performance and preparation.

457
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:23.800
Without preparation, we are unlikely, and you've heard it before, overcome the emotions that really cost us very dearly in the market.

458
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:43.080
Just to recap, I said early, once you have good market understanding, when you talk about traders that really do understand markets, they've got years of experience, once they got through the place where they understand the markets, they'll tell you that about 80% of their performance is tied to their emotional control or lack thereof.

459
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:51.040
Now, part of the difficulty in learning to trade, people say, well, they want to get their emotions under control first.

460
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:58.140
Well, if you don't understand how the markets work, it's pretty hard to work on the emotions because you really don't know.

461
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.380
You need a foundation.

462
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:08.460
You need to understand you really do understand the markets, then to start to identify the emotional issues and really deal with them.

463
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.560
So, you know, it's hard, in my opinion, to work on both of them together.

464
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.620
I think you need that market understanding.

465
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:29.600
And as I told one of the folks that helped set all this up in the first place, what we do on market understanding probably ought to come first, and then the second step ought to be the psychological understanding.

466
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:36.200
One of the individuals in our class today works with traders on the emotional side of the market.

467
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.560
But also, he trades for himself.

468
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.940
He trades for himself.

469
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.200
He understands the markets.

470
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.720
He's getting better and better and teaches the emotion.

471
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.220
You want to talk about somebody that's powerful?

472
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.660
Try and teach the emotional aspects of it when you don't understand trading, you don't understand what the trader's dealing with.

473
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.300
That's pretty tough.

474
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.100
I mean, you're doing it in a vacuum.

475
00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:04.620
Take somebody like Mark that understands the trading aspects and is going through this in detail and with all the material.

476
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.560
And now combine that with the emotional understanding.

477
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.480
All of a sudden, you've got a much more powerful weapon out there.

478
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.880
And that's really what it takes.

479
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.120
It is a combination of both.

480
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:24.620
And the preparation, being prepared, does an awful lot to get those emotions in check.

481
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.900
When you're not prepared, you're walking in cold, you can have a lot of problems in the day.

482
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:30.280
Okay?

483
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.260
Background.

484
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.940
I mentioned this earlier.

485
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.440
You need to make, and you're doing your preparation, you need to make a statement.

486
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.400
What's driving the market?

487
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:41.280
Okay?

488
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.680
Sometimes you have a market that's totally trading on its own.

489
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:53.520
A really strong market with strong conviction trades on its own, and it doesn't care what is going on in any other market.

490
00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.800
The kind of markets that you get hurt in are the markets that are not trading on their own.

491
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.880
They're getting whipsawed by other markets and other inflows.

492
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.380
Those are markets with low conviction.

493
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.340
Those are markets that traders get cut off on very badly sometimes because they have no idea what's going on.

494
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.640
I just threw one example up here.

495
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.100
This was the S&P's.

496
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.060
It was on a Thursday.

497
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.740
Here is the market.

498
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.220
There is the high on the S&P.

499
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.340
There is the low on the dollar.

500
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.460
So the market was trading off of the dollar.

501
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.220
There is the low on the S&P.

502
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.040
There's the high on the dollar.

503
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.700
Try and trade that market.

504
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.440
Try and trade the S&P's.

505
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:52.140
When you have no idea this is what's going on, that makes it pretty tough.

506
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.540
You're going to get whipped very solidly.

507
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.100
So you ought to make a note.

508
00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.280
Is the market trading on its own or is it not trading on its own?

509
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.180
Bonds, if you trade bonds.

510
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.120
Are bonds trading on their own?

511
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:11.800
Or are they being driven by flight to safety or flight to quality of what's going on in Greece, in Portugal, in Spain?

512
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:12.980
Okay.

513
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.520
Those are real things that happen in the marketplace.

514
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.380
Whether they make sense or not.

515
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:27.260
When you look at the long-term research, the correlation between stocks and currencies is very questionable.

516
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.340
When you really look at it academically over a long-term basis.

517
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.460
But guess what?

518
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:39.340
In the real world, if this is what the market is doing this week, this month, or the next two months, guess what?

519
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.600
That's what matters.

520
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:41.960
You're traders.

521
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.360
You're going to be a trader.

522
00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.160
You have to understand these relationships.

523
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.220
And these things happen all the time.

524
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:54.760
So if you start out by just making a small statement as you're preparing to trade and say, hey, this market is weak.

525
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.040
It's not trading on its own.

526
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.900
Next, I start with a top-down approach.

527
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.340
What I'm trying to do is always get as broad a perspective as I can.

528
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.920
I start from the top down.

529
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.580
Then I get all the way down finally so I can develop my strategy and my tactics.

530
00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.740
If I start here, I look at a monthly.

531
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.700
I look at a monthly.

532
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.740
I look at a weekly.

533
00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.620
Then I come over here and I look at a daily.

534
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:31.940
So if I just take the monthly, the weekly, and the daily, do you see the same perspective looking at all of those?

535
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:38.180
Or does each one of those give you a slightly different perspective of what's going on in the marketplace?

536
00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.260
You know, there's the weekly.

537
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.900
The weeklies come down to here, right?

538
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.880
There's the daily going up to here.

539
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.640
So you can get, there's the best top reference up there.

540
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.900
We just broke above this area right here.

541
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.080
Okay?

542
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.660
So I've got a breakout.

543
00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.200
I've got a breakout on the weekly chart above this level.

544
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.400
Which takes precedent?

545
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.260
The weekly or the daily?

546
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.860
It's going to be the weekly because the longer the time frame, the more relevant it is.

547
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.820
So that's where I start.

548
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.900
I start with the background.

549
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.560
I then look at the monthly, the weekly, the daily.

550
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.740
And I just keep walking through this from a top-down approach.

551
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:23.420
Okay?

552
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.720
Let's take a look.

553
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.720
In a trending market, where are we in the trend?

554
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.420
You've seen some of these charts before.

555
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.780
Am I in the early part of the trend?

556
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.520
Am I in the late part of the trend?

557
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.820
Here I had a multi-day, well right here, when it got here, I had a four-day balance, a three-day balance, right?

558
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.040
I looked before it, and I failed.

559
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.020
I came back up.

560
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:43.740
Okay?

561
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.480
So now I've got a longer balance.

562
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.020
But right here, I would have looked below this.

563
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.360
I looked on this day.

564
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.340
I probably got some follow-through early in the morning.

565
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.440
Got rejected.

566
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.400
I have excess.

567
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.940
So I'm looking.

568
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.800
Not only am I starting very big, but I keep coming down into smaller and smaller time frames.

569
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.180
Most of my trading is pretty short term.

570
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.220
So I keep coming down to what am I strategy?

571
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.780
What's my tactics going to be?

572
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.460
And I just start the top-down.

573
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.340
And then I start looking at and working at it a step at a time.

574
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.120
Okay?

575
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.460
What time frame is controlling the market?

576
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.560
You know, is it the day time frame?

577
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.480
Let's say I have three days of balance where the market does nothing.

578
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.480
It stays very tight for three days.

579
00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.280
Who's probably controlling that market?

580
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.320
Probably the day time frame, right?

581
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.700
Now, I've got every day I'm getting higher value.

582
00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.660
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

583
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.620
Who do you think is controlling that market?

584
00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.120
Probably not the day time frame, right?

585
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.280
At a minimum, it's the short time frame.

586
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.380
If it's more than three to five days, it's probably at least the intermediate term time frame.

587
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:58.380
The bigger the time frame, the more significant what is occurring in the market is happening.

588
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.020
I'll look and I'll see where's the center of the ring, just to have some idea where my trade location is.

589
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.900
These are all charts you've seen before.

590
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:10.800
But they become part of what I do for my daily preparation to trade.

591
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:11.680
Okay?

592
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.200
Now, an inside day.

593
00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.920
An inside day is a form of what?

594
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.680
It's a form of balance, right?

595
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.440
I can have balance.

596
00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.360
I can have five months of balance.

597
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.580
I can have three weeks of balance.

598
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.240
If I'm trading 30-minute bars, I can have three periods of balance.

599
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.200
An inside day is balance.

600
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.600
The market has come into balance.

601
00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:37.820
Okay?

602
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:45.480
When I come into balance, I find very little incentive to take any trade home from balance.

603
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.880
In balance, the market is looking for more information before it makes its next directional move.

604
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.600
So what I want to do is be prepared to trade any move outside of balance.

605
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.680
So I say, okay, if I get an inside day, I've got balance.

606
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.700
I start thinking I've got three scenarios, right?

607
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.400
Scenario one, it stays in balance.

608
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.860
Scenario two, it looks outside of balance.

609
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.520
Fails, come back in.

610
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.380
Scenario three, it goes.

611
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:19.240
So here, if I have an inside day, if the market opens and starts to trade out of balance to the downside,

612
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.800
I won't go with that trade in the morning.

613
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.580
The concepts are the same if you're using 30-minute bars throughout the day.

614
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.360
I don't care.

615
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.940
I use 30-minute bars.

616
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.760
But the concepts, no matter what time frame you're talking about, the concepts are exactly the same.

617
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.720
Okay?

618
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:37.800
Okay?

619
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.260
We've talked about this earlier, too.

620
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.940
A trend we talk about is the market trending.

621
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.940
It's not a mutually exclusive statement.

622
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.720
You can have a long-term trend up.

623
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.640
You can have an intermediate-term trend down within the long-term trend up.

624
00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.960
Be very natural, right?

625
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.880
Markets trend up.

626
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.680
You get an intermediate-term trend to the downside.

627
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.480
Within the intermediate-term trend, you could have a short-term trend to the upside.

628
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.420
And within the short-term trend to the upside, you could have a daytime frame trend to the downside.

629
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.260
So they're not mutually exclusive.

630
00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:22.520
But, again, you need to have some idea of what is going on in the market.

631
00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.060
Right now, it sounds very ambiguous.

632
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:32.720
As time goes on, you will find that this becomes more intuitive and more natural.

633
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.640
I was telling the folks the other day, talking about when you get to be intuitive.

634
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:45.580
For the first time the other day, I took a two-hour trip on a Segway off of Navy Pier here in Chicago.

635
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.760
I've never been on a Segway.

636
00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.520
It's not, when I look at it, it's not very intuitive, right?

637
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.820
To think you're going to stand on two wheels and you're not going to fall over and break your forehead or your back.

638
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.600
So when you first get on, when you first get on that Segway, you're a little hesitant.

639
00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.700
You know, you put one foot up, keep the other foot on the ground.

640
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.640
You kind of rock that one foot to make sure you're okay.

641
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.560
And then the guy that, you got somebody coaching you and he's encouraging you, it'll be okay.

642
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.680
He'll hold it and steady it for you, right?

643
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.820
You're not sure if you believe him or not.

644
00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.240
You finally put the other foot up, he leaves go and guess what?

645
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.540
You're standing straight up.

646
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.480
You're not falling over forward or backwards.

647
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.620
And then he said, okay, now here's how you go forward.

648
00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.780
You just kind of lean forward like you're going to fall.

649
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.580
I'm not falling for that, right?

650
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:30.940
Oh, no.

651
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.380
All of a sudden you lean forward and it starts to go.

652
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.380
He said, when you want to stop, you just lean back.

653
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.220
I'm not falling for that either, right?

654
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.740
But I decide I want to stop, so I start to lean back.

655
00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:48.740
Within about 10 minutes, within about 10 minutes, all of a sudden you realize how intuitive the segue is.

656
00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.760
All of a sudden I'm coming down the street and I'm looking, there's a fire hydrant and it's like skis.

657
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.780
All of a sudden you kind of go like this to the left of the fire hydrant, right around it to the right.

658
00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.380
You say, wait a minute.

659
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:04.320
And that's kind of what happens to you over a period of time as you're in the market.

660
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.220
You find out with the more experience you get, the more intuitive it comes.

661
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.260
Okay.

662
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.680
Identifying trading ranges and extremes.

663
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.280
We've been through this again.

664
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.100
They're not that hard to do.

665
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.000
They kind of fall out.

666
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.240
The markets are very what?

667
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.520
They're very visual.

668
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.140
Okay.

669
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.440
They're very visual.

670
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.120
And you start to be able to see these trading ranges.

671
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.760
You start to be able to see excess.

672
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.580
Does it happen overnight?

673
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.520
No.

674
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.780
When you first start looking at it and say, well, you know, do I make it here?

675
00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.540
Do I make it here?

676
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:45.600
Over a period of time, you start losing the ability to want to make it exactly linear.

677
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.860
You start accepting that there's a little give and take in it.

678
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.540
And you start to see, okay, I can see.

679
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.700
I can see some balance.

680
00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.240
I can look here.

681
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.780
I have a balance area here.

682
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.680
I break out of this.

683
00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:03.740
And I said, okay, if it's a clean break, if it's a clean break, how much distance should

684
00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.000
I have between this balance area and the next one?

685
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
I should be able to put a pencil in my finger, right?

686
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.300
When I look at this, it tried to break out of balance here.

687
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.220
Is it clean?

688
00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.000
You see it?

689
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.940
It's not clean.

690
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.420
It's sitting right on top of it.

691
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.160
It's back in it.

692
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.760
And we come back down.

693
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.080
Does that happen all the time?

694
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.600
No.

695
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.600
No.

696
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.880
But it is something to record.

697
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.640
But I got, and I got excess.

698
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.720
I start to get more intuitive about excess.

699
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.620
I start to get more intuitive about what is a profile going to look like at the end of

700
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.980
the day, at a completed day.

701
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:42.240
So you're identifying the ranges and the extremes.

702
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:47.880
You're just trying to get a perspective of the marketplace.

703
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.540
And if you move forward, what makes the market profile unique?

704
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.300
We talked about it before, right?

705
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.140
The synthesis, it combines everything.

706
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:02.200
We saw the graphic of Napoleon going into Russia.

707
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.780
We saw the holistic view of it.

708
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.280
The very broad army, we saw the army narrow.

709
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.940
We saw the temperatures rise.

710
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.520
Are the temperatures lower?

711
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.040
We saw the food supply dwindle.

712
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.840
But if you then take it apart, we can study the size of the army.

713
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.960
We can study the temperature.

714
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.720
We can study the food supply separately, right?

715
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.340
So we can take it apart and do more analysis.

716
00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.580
Successful trading is a combination of both, okay?

717
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.440
Again, review.

718
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.800
When you go up, we have the first structure we looked at.

719
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.860
What kind of business is this?

720
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.140
Old business, right?

721
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.560
It's short covering.

722
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.140
Does short covering weaken or strengthen the market?

723
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.680
It weakens the market because it takes buying power.

724
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.920
We have a primary day.

725
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.200
A primary day is a rename.

726
00:42:51.200 --> 00:43:00.680
If somebody is reading the original book, Mind Over Markets, we've changed the name on a few of the days because I think they're more meaningful names.

727
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.080
It's a primary day.

728
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.780
It's kind of our base day that we judge all others from.

729
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.460
On the side, we've got a liquidating day, a B formation.

730
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.900
Old business and new business.

731
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.100
It's old business, okay?

732
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.320
And you just start to become second nature to you.

733
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.420
Let's take a look a little further.

734
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.680
We talk about combining things, analysis.

735
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.820
So now, let's talk about the combination.

736
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.580
I showed you how I track the volume.

737
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:35.160
If I'm trading equities or the S&Ps, I track it by half-hour periods.

738
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.840
I look at the total for the day.

739
00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.560
So now, let's see how I would put this together.

740
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:50.820
Let's say that my attempted direction is up on the S&Ps today and my volume declines.

741
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.200
Okay?

742
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.020
I can make an analysis, right?

743
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.320
Attempted direction up, I get lower volume.

744
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.680
Or I have another day, attempted direction is up, and I get higher volume.

745
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.020
So I can take and I'm doing my analysis.

746
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.160
I can start to look at volume.

747
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.460
I can look at it in relationship to attempted direction.

748
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.040
I can look at it to was the value higher or lower?

749
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.500
Was price higher or lower?

750
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.640
You know, did I break out of it?

751
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:28.640
I start to combine these together with my analysis.

752
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.260
So it's not a single type.

753
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.100
It's not a single type of analysis.

754
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.060
This is the really good traders.

755
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:42.400
The really good traders do a wonderful job of maintaining holistic view of the marketplace,

756
00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.640
but also are also very astute in doing the work for analysis.

757
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:56.940
So there's a combination of a little bit of a perfectionist and wanting linearity to it and versus keeping a holistic understanding.

758
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.200
It takes, it takes, really takes a balance in there.

759
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.460
What time frame is dominating the market?

760
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.960
Day time frame references, we've talked about those.

761
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:14.200
Double distribution days, we treat each as two separate days.

762
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:20.320
Again, even on a double distribution day, I'd look to see what direction was the market trying to go.

763
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.460
Even if I got it, I'd look at the volume, give me a better idea.

764
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:29.620
We looked at three-day balance, day time frame references.

765
00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.100
We've been through this process.

766
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.320
We're just kind of reviewing through it.

767
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.960
We've looked at anomalies before, right?

768
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.020
Anomalies are rough edges on the profile.

769
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.480
There are areas where there was lack symmetry.

770
00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.660
There's some kind of message in there.

771
00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:51.260
We look at another thing in the preparation from the NASDAQ.

772
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:57.220
Now, the NASDAQ has a website, and everybody's got one someplace.

773
00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:05.020
But it allows you to go and see what news is scheduled to be announced on this particular day.

774
00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:12.880
So on Monday, May 3rd, we can look up here, and we can see that we had personal income in outlays at 830.

775
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.760
We had ISM manufacturing at 10, construction spending at 11.

776
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:26.420
We come over here, and we see we have a 30-year bond auction announcement at 9 a.m.

777
00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.920
So we know what news is coming.

778
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:38.380
It is important, particularly if you're a short-term trader, it is very important to know at what time a news announcement is coming.

779
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:46.660
Now, I do not want to know what the news announcement is.

780
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.460
I want to know when it's coming.

781
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.120
I want to read the market's reaction to it on my own.

782
00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:03.700
If, in fact, I read the number, oh, and it looks like a bearish number, and I don't have the basis to know if it's a bearish number or not.

783
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:04.460
I'm reading the headline.

784
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.220
The real information is down below the surface.

785
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.700
It's below the adjustments.

786
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.540
What was the expectation?

787
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:19.160
I want to see how the market reacts in there, and I know there's a lot of crude traders in here.

788
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.860
My biggest market has been on the NYMEX and the crude traders over the years.

789
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:30.140
And, of course, you know, if you're a crude trader, you can't resist looking at the number, right?

790
00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.900
You know, you're addicted to it, even though you know what my answer would be, right?

791
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.500
And how many times do you see the market do just the opposite of what the number was?

792
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:48.580
If you've got good structure, if you've got good solid structure on the market and the number is negative, a lot of times you get a fast dip down, it's gone.

793
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.200
Or if there's a strong trend underway, the market doesn't care.

794
00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.480
Stocks have been going down recently.

795
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.040
Good numbers, bad numbers.

796
00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.820
Doesn't make any difference.

797
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920
The market's going lower.

798
00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.820
All I want to know is what time is the announcement coming.

799
00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:09.800
I want to know that because I can expect some volatility around that number, and I may elect not to have a position on at that time.

800
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.420
If I'm going to have a position on, I want to at least understand what is going on in the marketplace.

801
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:25.700
The narrative is nothing more than putting into words what you're seeing in the marketplace.

802
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.100
It's the recap of all the work you've done.

803
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:34.080
After you go through, you look at your references, you look at your background and everything else,

804
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.440
you want to recap it into a narrative form, written form.

805
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:43.340
You don't want it to be very big because you don't want to create a bottleneck.

806
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.920
If you make it big and you write a book, all of a sudden it's like running.

807
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.920
You run a half a mile today and a mile tomorrow.

808
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.580
Within three days you're no longer running because it's too long.

809
00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.820
You don't want to create a bottleneck.

810
00:48:54.820 --> 00:49:00.560
But what everybody, nobody disagrees with me usually initially about this,

811
00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:07.600
but the number of people that actually will do the narrative that we recommend is almost minuscule.

812
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:13.700
Sounds good, but everybody knows that they know, they understand it, they know what's going on.

813
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.680
They don't need to do that.

814
00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.800
All of a sudden you know what's going on.

815
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:25.660
When you go to write a narrative, all of a sudden you start to write the narrative and the words don't flow very easily.

816
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.260
What do you think your grasp is of what's really going on?

817
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.460
It's not very good, right?

818
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.280
If you're writing the narrative, you really understand what's going on,

819
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.340
it ought to come off real quick and real smooth.

820
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.840
The process of writing the narrative.

821
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.040
Say, okay, the narrative may say nothing more.

822
00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.320
I'm in a 10-day balance.

823
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.820
I'm in a 10-day balance.

824
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.340
My trade location is at the top of the 10-day balance.

825
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.640
Structure has not been very good on the upside.

826
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.680
Volume has been declining.

827
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.980
I'm looking for, I mean, I don't know what it's going to work.

828
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.140
We'll send you something to kind of help you with that.

829
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.840
It doesn't have to be a book.

830
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:13.540
But that, if you do that, you've got a much greater shot of doing the right thing when the market's open in the morning.

831
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.460
Some people mistake a narrative.

832
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.140
They spend a lot of work and they put in the reference points.

833
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.480
They mark the reference points.

834
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.020
And they've got stars here and notations here.

835
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.840
That's linear work of marking the references.

836
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:28.880
Easy to work.

837
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:29.620
It's good work.

838
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.680
Boy, you really feel busy.

839
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.380
You know, you get straight edge out.

840
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.460
You can draw trend lines.

841
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.220
You can do this.

842
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.600
You go, boy, I've really worked hard.

843
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.780
But you haven't gone to another step of writing the narrative.

844
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.260
If the background, maybe the narrative says nothing more.

845
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.540
That the S&Ps are not trading on.

846
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.140
They're not trading on their own.

847
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:53.940
They're still being influenced by the movement in the dollar affected by what's going on in Europe and with the euro.

848
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.400
Okay?

849
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.380
You already knew that.

850
00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:03.060
But writing it down puts it in a different location in your mind and brings it front and center to what you're doing.

851
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:14.500
Also in the narrative, the very last portion of the narrative is you ought to develop two or three trading scenarios for tomorrow.

852
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:23.520
So you ought to have two or three things that you know you want to do if you get the right opportunity tomorrow.

853
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.280
It's a lot easier to react when you already have thought about it.

854
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:35.540
There's enough things that come up in the market that we never thought about, didn't imagine, that come out of nowhere.

855
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:43.000
If we can get rid of and be prepared for those that are expected, it's easier to handle the unexpected.

856
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:46.900
But we will give you part of this when we get it done.

857
00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.520
We'll be a write-up on it.

858
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.840
It's really a way to put it all together.

859
00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:59.720
Let's take a look now at what you might look at in a real week in the market.

860
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:08.680
The example provides us with an extreme unique opportunity to appreciate structure, how structure forms, how structure relates to object-based trading.

861
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:19.720
And the intention of this market situation is to bring into focus those things that we have talked about today.

862
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:25.720
So it's the week of April 9th to April 16th.

863
00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.800
Let's back up one slide for a second.

864
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:34.020
So we are, there's the week we are focusing on in there.

865
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.720
There's the 9th, there's the 16th.

866
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:37.800
Okay?

867
00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:38.720
Let's go forward.

868
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.620
Late Friday.

869
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.400
Remember us talking about this day earlier?

870
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.300
We showed this day earlier.

871
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:51.600
Late Friday when sellers didn't appear, momentum traders pushed the prices back up.

872
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.480
No elongation.

873
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.340
Longer-term frame sellers have limited interest in here.

874
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.160
Limited interest here we never would have gotten here.

875
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.260
The low was made early.

876
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.840
It was a poor low.

877
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.260
Tempted direction was up.

878
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.740
So that's my starting point.

879
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.380
That happened on a Friday.

880
00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.920
We introduced this early.

881
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.380
Now you're seeing it again.

882
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.280
We're going to walk through what goes on.

883
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:22.660
Now, when I look at the second day, well first of all, when I do my scenarios, I got a pretty good idea.

884
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.240
I saw this day, this Friday.

885
00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:31.280
I knew there were no sellers, but I really didn't think this was real and I didn't think it could hold this.

886
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.420
It didn't have the volume.

887
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.140
I didn't have the shape.

888
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.620
I didn't have the conviction.

889
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:40.700
I had a pretty good feeling that I had momentum players playing a game on Friday afternoon.

890
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:41.140
Why?

891
00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.480
Because they can, right?

892
00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.700
And price-based traders, markets up.

893
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.700
They buy it on Friday afternoon.

894
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:53.260
It's like going to the track where you can change your bet.

895
00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:54.320
Why not?

896
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.060
It's going up.

897
00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.020
So they come along.

898
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.880
And on, this is a late spike.

899
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.340
Let's talk about spikes for a second.

900
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:08.900
This is another example of a spike late in the day or a price probe to the upside.

901
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:09.860
Okay?

902
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.460
If this is the late price probe up, this is the base of the spike.

903
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:14.540
What is this called?

904
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.140
Support, right?

905
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.700
The base of the spike is support.

906
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.340
If the market opens and stays within the spike, is the spike accepted or rejected?

907
00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.780
It's going to be accepted.

908
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.020
Over time, we're getting accepted.

909
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:38.260
If it opened above the spike, the market hadn't gone high enough to cut off the buy.

910
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:44.780
So when I look at this, part of my scenario, I think there's a pretty good chance we're coming back here.

911
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.560
But I don't know that.

912
00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.900
You never know anything for certain.

913
00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.940
Then I get a balanced, pretty balanced day on Monday.

914
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.960
I'm within the spike, but it never got down here.

915
00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.080
It never got down through support.

916
00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:00.280
Okay?

917
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.260
So value is higher.

918
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.740
However, no elongation.

919
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.700
I have a wide point of control here.

920
00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.720
I have down here.

921
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.460
No real evidence of longer term buyers because they really didn't push it.

922
00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.100
Sellers remain absent.

923
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.320
Poor low.

924
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.960
Poor low.

925
00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:19.160
Now I have a poor low here, right?

926
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.940
And I have a poor low here.

927
00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.640
Let me give you another difficult concept.

928
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:31.540
I don't use a point count, but let's assume that I did.

929
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:36.380
Let's say if I had a poor low, I called it a minus five.

930
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.860
So I'm doing some computer model.

931
00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.660
Poor low, I call it a minus five.

932
00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.060
Okay?

933
00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.380
I don't do that, but let's assume that I did.

934
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:50.480
Now, if I had one poor low, that's a single data point.

935
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.900
It may or not be taken out.

936
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.300
It's significant.

937
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.160
It's significant, but it's minor.

938
00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:06.500
If I have two poor lows back to back, I now start to get some exponential type of evidence.

939
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:16.240
So if one poor low was minus five, maybe two poor lows back to back might be something like minus 25, minus 30, minus 35.

940
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:23.220
So I kind of get an exponential expansion of two poor lows back to back.

941
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.660
Are really increasing the odds.

942
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:30.580
They're increasing the odds against that person that's long.

943
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.500
They're increasing the odds that I'm going to have to look below those lows.

944
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.040
So I go through that.

945
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.880
I've got two poor lows back to back.

946
00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.620
I've got my support.

947
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.220
I haven't gone through support here.

948
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:43.300
Okay?

949
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.880
So I've got, so I didn't get through support.

950
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.240
That's positive, right?

951
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.120
I got accepted, positive, but I got two back to back lows.

952
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.700
Am I getting conflicting information?

953
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.040
I'm getting conflicting information all the time.

954
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:06.160
If, in fact, there was no conflicting information, the trend would be going in one direction.

955
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.500
Everybody would be very much aware of it, right?

956
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.340
What is my opportunity?

957
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.500
Pretty limited, right?

958
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.680
Be very limited.

959
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:21.100
Within the conflicting information starts to make the situation more ambiguous, right?

960
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.220
Right?

961
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:30.420
More ambiguous it is, the more opportunity I may have if I can wade through that and find

962
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.840
the opportunity within that ambiguity.

963
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.960
Remember, most people loathe ambiguity.

964
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.740
They want to know, where do I get in?

965
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.360
Where do I get out?

966
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.540
Jim, this is of no value to me.

967
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.680
You didn't tell me where to buy.

968
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.200
You didn't tell me where to sell.

969
00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.440
I don't need you.

970
00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.600
And you say, you know, that's not what we do.

971
00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.400
It's not really how markets work.

972
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:57.320
And if it was that simple, it would be arbitraged away in moments.

973
00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:02.540
It would be in some computer program on some algorithm overnight.

974
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.040
Okay?

975
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.580
The power in this is understanding the complexity and the ambiguity.

976
00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.580
So now I've got conflicting information.

977
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.120
It was also interesting.

978
00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.040
One of my friends at a hedge fund told me, he said he was talking to other people at the

979
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.300
hedge funds, and they had sworn off shorting.

980
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.740
They had sworn off shorting because every time they shorted, they got punished.

981
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:28.760
They got punished.

982
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.280
They weren't going to short anymore.

983
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:34.540
So I just wrote, I said, can the correction be far at hand?

984
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.260
And it's amazing.

985
00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.160
Even hedge funds are supposed to be sophisticated.

986
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:50.860
One of my jobs, when I went back to UBS in 2001, they had a problem in the hedge fund area.

987
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.080
They were getting some suits, and I was asked to come back, review the process, and review

988
00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:00.000
a lot of the hedge funds that were in the system or should be in the systems, etc.

989
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:00.720
So I went back.

990
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.460
It was an interesting job.

991
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:05.800
No hard feeling.

992
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.380
My wife had passed away.

993
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.040
They asked me to come back.

994
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.920
It was an interesting situation.

995
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.160
Very challenging.

996
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.880
And it was fun.

997
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:22.900
I learned more by talking to all these quote-unquote sophisticated hedge funds and traveling the

998
00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.520
country, talking to them, interviewing them.

999
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:31.920
And it was also fun because I'd go in and they'd think, here's some guy from this brokerage

1000
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.200
firm.

1001
00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:37.200
So they're just going to, you know, kind of blow a little smoke at you, close your eyelids,

1002
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.120
and you'd sit there and listen to them.

1003
00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.980
And when they'd get done talking, you'd start to ask questions.

1004
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.360
And all of a sudden, they'd say, uh-oh.

1005
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.200
They'd start to get a little upset with some of the questions you ask.

1006
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.240
And all of a sudden, they realize, whoa, wait a minute.

1007
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.640
Maybe he doesn't know something about trading.

1008
00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.100
Well, then you get in there and you start to say, wait a minute.

1009
00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.980
What do they know about trading?

1010
00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:03.100
And I can remember coming back from one trip and saying, every single hedge fund I talked

1011
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.540
to on a swing through the West Coast, and I saw 10 of them and they were all pretty good

1012
01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:12.900
size, every single one of them had the same basic position.

1013
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.220
Somebody came up to me earlier and they said it was amazing that I mentioned Bear Stearns

1014
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.180
because they said they used to be on the floor at the exchange.

1015
01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:28.440
And they said, it was interesting, if Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs did a trade, Bear

1016
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.520
Stearns would imitate the trade immediately.

1017
01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.720
Well, guess what?

1018
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:37.860
When you get everybody, longest time frame, going the same way, what is your risk?

1019
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.520
And when they try and get out the door, what do you think is going to happen?

1020
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:42.740
Okay.

1021
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:49.580
So when we go back and look at this, we've got two bad lows back-to-back on there.

1022
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.200
And we start to look at what's going on.

1023
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.980
Now, we come in on April 13th.

1024
01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.000
We talked about this bad structure down here, the two bad lows.

1025
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.420
Now the market, we open lower, we go back.

1026
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.900
We don't take out this low, but we repair this.

1027
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.200
We take out this low.

1028
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:14.520
And the market has come back down and checked this out.

1029
01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.580
Remember, I thought this was kind of bogus, the way it broke out above there.

1030
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.460
I think it's pretty hard to hold this when it's this fat.

1031
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.080
It got up here probably on a Friday afternoon, a couple bad lows.

1032
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.440
It did come back and check it out.

1033
01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:34.320
The market, one of the things that's interesting here, the market is very much like we are as people.

1034
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.680
You know, I would really, as I'm sitting here doing this video, and I know some of you I've never met before.

1035
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.620
Some of you do know.

1036
01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.080
And the temptation is you want to say, hey, how am I doing?

1037
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:45.920
Am I doing okay?

1038
01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.260
Because it's all a little bit of our insecurity coming out, right?

1039
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.620
And the market is very similar.

1040
01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.420
If you think about it, it's kind of, it's a composite.

1041
01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:02.100
But this, in a way, I always have looked at this, it's like the market coming to check this out and saying, how am I doing?

1042
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:02.840
Am I doing okay?

1043
01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.660
And it comes down here.

1044
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:12.180
It comes, it revisits this area, kind of repairs this structure, and it gets an affirmation that everything's okay, right?

1045
01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.460
And then, once it's checked this out, it gets encouragement, everything's okay.

1046
01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.040
And the market starts back up.

1047
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.200
We get our buying tail, and we start to go back and auction higher.

1048
01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.000
So the early break Tuesday repaired most of the, most of what was going on.

1049
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:38.900
Now, when we said we went down and then we went back up, one of the things we also were getting, what kind of information were we getting?

1050
01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.900
Conflicting information, right?

1051
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.220
So guess what?

1052
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:50.260
Both of us, we got, we got, that took that conflicting information, we went lower, and we went higher.

1053
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.340
The question is, which one was going to happen first?

1054
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.460
But as long as you know that and you can go through that process, you can get prepared.

1055
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:05.400
If you had this as a reference point, your reference point, you get down there, you didn't take out Friday's low.

1056
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:06.840
Do you have a reference?

1057
01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.880
Should you have had that already on your chart?

1058
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.040
Yes, you should have.

1059
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.220
You get down there, you don't take it.

1060
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.080
Now, when you didn't take it, did it come out of here quickly or slowly?

1061
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.020
Came out pretty quickly, right?

1062
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.760
So as it got down, as it got down to the low on Friday, traders were ready to do what?

1063
01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.280
Remember, on the floor, this means buy, right?

1064
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.340
The longer the tail, the more aggressive they were.

1065
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.040
And they didn't even let it get to the low.

1066
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.180
So there was some aggressive buying going on.

1067
01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.440
You've got excess.

1068
01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.420
You saw excess a while ago, longer term excess from the February 5th low.

1069
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.560
You're seeing a little different type of excess right here.

1070
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.800
So there was conflicting information.

1071
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.880
But the pieces come together.

1072
01:03:51.880 --> 01:04:01.460
And if you have a mental flexibility, you can make the analysis and you can work through trading these markets.

1073
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.060
References are extremely important.

1074
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.580
Volume, shape, repair.

1075
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:07.580
Okay?

1076
01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:13.320
Here is a perfect, perfect S&P trade.

1077
01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.140
If you are prepared for the trade.

1078
01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:21.140
The market gaps higher.

1079
01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.840
The market gaps higher.

1080
01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.500
And it gapped higher in A period.

1081
01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.280
Trades a little higher.

1082
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.080
And in the second period, B period.

1083
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:31.980
A period.

1084
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.500
B period.

1085
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.160
Comes down.

1086
01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.580
And guess what it can't do?

1087
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.160
It can't close the gap.

1088
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:46.520
That is your perfect daytime frame trade.

1089
01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.140
Down there.

1090
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:53.960
Now, when you get down here, it's kind of strange.

1091
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.360
Because remember, it went up which way first?

1092
01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.800
Went up in A, then it came down in B.

1093
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.980
There's a word I use.

1094
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.560
It's called, how many people have heard it before?

1095
01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.640
It's called tempo, right?

1096
01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.260
Let me tell you what this looks like.

1097
01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.800
If you're coming down towards that low.

1098
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:16.780
The tempo, the market will have trouble taking out this low.

1099
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.540
The tempo will start to slow.

1100
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.520
And it will kind of push like this.

1101
01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.720
And it will kind of push again.

1102
01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.760
And one of the things that you learn with cumulative experience is to feel the market.

1103
01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:35.160
When, if the tempo is slow, you're above yesterday's high.

1104
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:45.420
You have, I think, longer term traders that wanted to sell can sell at a higher price than they could have yesterday without a question, right?

1105
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.060
The market's coming down and the tempo is slow.

1106
01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.900
Do you think the longer term sellers are there or the aggressive sellers are there?

1107
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:54.560
No.

1108
01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.180
Now, I'll get all kind of questions.

1109
01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:00.940
Well, Jim, explain to me again what tempo is.

1110
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.360
You have to experience.

1111
01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:12.200
But if you know to look for tempo, over a period of time, you will start to understand what tempo is.

1112
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.320
You're in the traffic.

1113
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:25.960
You know, if you're, if most of the traffic's going 67 miles an hour and you're at about 66, 67, your tempo, your flow is pretty much with the traffic, right?

1114
01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.680
Now, all of a sudden, you're in and out of traffic.

1115
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.720
You're trying to get someplace.

1116
01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.740
Your tempo is out of sync with the, with the traffic.

1117
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.820
That's another form of tempo, right?

1118
01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:41.940
So, when you're coming down like this, the tempo starts to slow and all of a sudden, it goes through your mind.

1119
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:42.940
You recognize it.

1120
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.380
You don't have anything other than tempo to go on.

1121
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.460
You have your reference.

1122
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.760
You're watching the gap.

1123
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.680
You're trying to see if they can close the gap.

1124
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.520
They can't close the gap.

1125
01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.300
That's your buying opportunity.

1126
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.940
However, if you got your mind all messed up, oh, price opened higher, went higher.

1127
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.080
Now, it's trying to sell off.

1128
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:00.980
Oh, my golly.

1129
01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.920
This thing could really destroy me.

1130
01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.000
Now, you brought yourself to a point of indecision.

1131
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.900
You can't make the decision to get long that market.

1132
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:17.640
Going long this market at the right price is going to fly in the face of what's been happening for the last half hour or so, right?

1133
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:22.380
If you have nothing, you have no context.

1134
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.540
You don't know it's higher.

1135
01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.800
You don't know you got the gap.

1136
01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.400
You don't know the tempo's slow.

1137
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:33.340
You have no context at which to judge what's going on or another situation.

1138
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.620
You're going to trade the S&Ps.

1139
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.180
The market's going to open substantially higher.

1140
01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.160
You see the overnight trade is substantially higher.

1141
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.660
It would be expected when the market opens.

1142
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.580
It's the first thing you would expect traders to do would be what?

1143
01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.460
Take some profit.

1144
01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.220
So, the market owns substantially higher overnight.

1145
01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.600
The first thing they do is they're taking profit.

1146
01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.500
And if you don't understand, it's just a little profit taking.

1147
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.820
You get sucked into profit taking.

1148
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.540
And all of a sudden, you're not going to get lower value.

1149
01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.020
You can't close the gap.

1150
01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.160
All you got was some profit taking.

1151
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.060
You remove some weak longs from overnight.

1152
01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.880
Time, chance to get long in the market.

1153
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.940
But if all of a sudden, you're focused on that price, you saw a price.

1154
01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:21.880
And a lot of times, when the overnight inventory is long, you open higher in the S&Ps.

1155
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.520
You may see them starting to sell from the open belt.

1156
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.440
Oh, boy.

1157
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.560
This market's really weak.

1158
01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.000
Then all of a sudden, you realize, wait a minute.

1159
01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.220
Tempo's slowing.

1160
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.860
They can't get the gap.

1161
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.620
You'll see this situation.

1162
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.100
And it usually can be a pretty good trade.

1163
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:48.680
The good for a daytime frame trade, now, as the market starts back up, now you start to look to see how smooth is that auction to the upside.

1164
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.300
It's a two-way auction process.

1165
01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.300
Continually auction from low to high, high to low.

1166
01:08:53.300 --> 01:09:04.720
Each auction contains within it evidence that's going to help you determine what the next results or the next auction or the following day may be.

1167
01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:14.160
Years ago, before they changed the tax law, and I was working for Payne-Weber and in the institutional area,

1168
01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:24.420
doctors and dentists and corporate people that wanted to have an outing and they wanted to write it off for tax purposes would have it at a nice location,

1169
01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.060
and they might come along and invite a speaker.

1170
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.520
So they had a speaker.

1171
01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:33.320
They could all get together after skiing and, you know, something and have a few beers and have a speaker.

1172
01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.500
They'd all write it off, right?

1173
01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.860
They changed the tax law and made it a little more difficult.

1174
01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.920
Well, anyhow, this one was in Las Vegas.

1175
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.220
Now, these guys, they probably got there the day before.

1176
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.980
So you know they're probably fairly tired.

1177
01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.080
They've been out golfing in meetings and drinking all day.

1178
01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.360
And now they've got to come and attend this seminar where I'm going to be the speaker that night.

1179
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.800
I'm going to talk about an inviting opportunity.

1180
01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:07.560
So what I decided to do, it was on trading, but I decided to give the whole seminar that night,

1181
01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:12.780
which I was going to keep to less than an hour, on blackjack in the market.

1182
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.740
And it's probably one of the best receptions I've ever had.

1183
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.640
Because normally what these guys come in, they come in, sign in, sit down.

1184
01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:24.900
They've physically been there if they ever get questioned, and they're gone.

1185
01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.200
No one left.

1186
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:31.020
And they said, we're going to talk tonight about trading and blackjack and the similarities.

1187
01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:37.240
And one of my first clients ever when I was in the brokerage business was a guy named Ed Thorpe.

1188
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.120
Ed Thorpe was one of, his original book was How to Beat the Dealer.

1189
01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.980
Had another book, How to Beat the Market.

1190
01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:47.940
One of these guys was a card counter, professor, University of California, Irvine campus.

1191
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.560
They finally told him that he might not want to come back to Las Vegas in there.

1192
01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.380
So a pretty good idea about the blackjack and the cards and what went on.

1193
01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.400
But the main theme, the main theme was in blackjack.

1194
01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.180
Because Ed was a card counter, I visioned myself as a card counter.

1195
01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.680
I don't remember ever needing a guard to take me home from Las Vegas.

1196
01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:21.600
But I said, in card counting and in blackjack, what has been played before has an effect on the statistical outcome of the following hand, right?

1197
01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.940
And assuming at this point, those, I'm so old, they played with single decks.

1198
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.240
They didn't have shoes and all of those back.

1199
01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.480
But what has been played before affects the outcome of what's going, what's going to happen forward.

1200
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:45.200
And I said, in trading and in investing, what has played out before has a lot to say about the odds and the outcome going forward.

1201
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.780
We saw the example earlier with two poor lows.

1202
01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:49.600
Okay?

1203
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.820
I think that has a lot to say about the outcome going forward.

1204
01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.080
And that is kind of what this idea of cumulative evidence about the market.

1205
01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:15.440
When the market was going up before it made its historic break, you know, a week or so ago, the structure, the cumulative evidence was saying that there was a tremendous amount of weakness in the market.

1206
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.060
Did I know it was going to happen?

1207
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.020
Did I predict it?

1208
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:18.440
No.

1209
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.860
But I knew that the evidence, that the underlying structure was relatively weak.

1210
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:23.840
Okay.

1211
01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.700
Let's take a look at what we've got here.

1212
01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:30.700
Overnight trade.

1213
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:39.000
Let me very briefly talk about what I do with the overnight trade.

1214
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.940
I already told you I use the overnight trade only for the reference of the high and the low.

1215
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.320
I also use it for one other thing.

1216
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.740
Was the overnight inventory long or short?

1217
01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.020
That's an awful difficult concept.

1218
01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:06.840
If the overnight inventory, if the close yesterday was at 6 and all the overnight inventory takes place above 6,

1219
01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.520
I come in and I say the overnight inventory is long.

1220
01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:22.900
Now, the trouble most people have with making any sense out of that is in a simple form, the economists will tell you,

1221
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.400
well, Jim, who cares?

1222
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.420
There has to be a buyer for every seller, right?

1223
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.940
Well, it's a buyer for every seller.

1224
01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.080
What do you care what the overnight inventory is?

1225
01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:31.440
Ha!

1226
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:39.600
The key is there doesn't necessarily have to be a long-term buyer matched with a long-term seller.

1227
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:50.200
What if I have a long-term buyer matched against a short-term seller or vice versa or any combination thereof?

1228
01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:58.400
If General Motors is a long-time frame manufacturer, right, in the business, they'd be considered long-time frame.

1229
01:13:59.060 --> 01:13:59.220
Okay?

1230
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.400
They are then selling cars or putting cars in the hands of the dealer.

1231
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.640
Are the dealers, do the dealers have the same motivation as General Motors?

1232
01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.020
No.

1233
01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:12.480
What does the dealer wants to do?

1234
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.280
He's a short-term player.

1235
01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.800
He wants to put a markup on it, right?

1236
01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.800
He wants to put a markup on it, get it out the door.

1237
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.240
Put a markup on it, get it out the door.

1238
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.500
The dealer is very much like the local used to be on a trading floor.

1239
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.220
Trading floor.

1240
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:33.200
So we've got an imbalance between what the long-time frame seller wants to do and what the short-time frame buyer wants to do.

1241
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:39.900
And Markets in Profile, the last book I wrote, talked about this example from the housing market.

1242
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:44.860
When the market first started, you had a contractor that built a home, had a contract.

1243
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.680
He built a home for a buyer.

1244
01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.340
That buyer was going to live in that home, right?

1245
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.920
You've got a pretty good match between the buyer and seller.

1246
01:14:53.380 --> 01:15:04.400
Well, as the market got a little bit hotter, the contractor decided he'd build one on contract, but maybe he'll do three or four specs to go along with it, right?

1247
01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:13.580
All of a sudden, you've got the buyer, instead of buying a home that they're going to live in, well, maybe they start up, maybe they'll buy a second home.

1248
01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:19.540
So we found near the top of the market, I don't remember the exact number, it was like 38% of the people had a second home.

1249
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.700
Then you had other people that started to talk about flipping the homes, right?

1250
01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.560
And we went to this woman down in Naples and had 50 homes.

1251
01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:34.940
Well, you kind of get an idea of the imbalance that can exist between different time frames and different motivations.

1252
01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:40.700
When you look, let's say that the overnight inventory in a market is higher.

1253
01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:49.360
The overnight inventory may represent only 10% to 15% of the same type of volume that would take place during the day.

1254
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:56.680
So if the market's up overnight, I know the high and the low, and if it's up overnight, I'm going to make an assumption that more than likely,

1255
01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.680
I've got the inventory in relatively weak hands overnight.

1256
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.500
It doesn't have to happen.

1257
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.940
But I kind of start and I want to know that.

1258
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.160
So I will take a look, I will take a look at that.

1259
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:16.320
I will also use the overnight market in order to place trades.

1260
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:26.460
I don't very often trade the overnight market, but that doesn't mean that I won't put an order to buy something at some level

1261
01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:31.200
that I want to buy it if the trade's down there in the overnight market.

1262
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:40.700
Earlier, we talked about a pullback low or some anomaly in the marketplace.

1263
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.860
Here was kind of an anomaly in the marketplace.

1264
01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.760
Thought it might come back to.

1265
01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.360
I had an order in to buy at this level overnight.

1266
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.160
And it got down to that level.

1267
01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.780
Do I necessarily recommend it?

1268
01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:55.040
No.

1269
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.080
But I had a reason for wanting to be in this market.

1270
01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.320
And I said, okay, where might I put an order?

1271
01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.960
This corresponds to about half back.

1272
01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.580
It corresponds to this anomaly.

1273
01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.820
And you can see the market got it with just a couple of ticks below that.

1274
01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:16.320
So from time to time, I will use that in order to get the markets that I want.

1275
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:26.140
But I also will say, if in fact the market can pull back too much overnight, if the market was really strong,

1276
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.000
it probably couldn't pull back that much.

1277
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.380
So again, I will gain information from that.

1278
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.080
Remember, it's nuances.

1279
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.280
It's nuances.

1280
01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:35.820
Okay?

1281
01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.040
Let's just kind of see where we are.

1282
01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.820
Let's move forward on here.

1283
01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:45.260
Thursday in here, built higher value.

1284
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.660
Remember, we did the buy overnight.

1285
01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:48.640
Higher with the trend.

1286
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.380
Markets really having trouble going higher.

1287
01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.680
Kind of going higher on vapors.

1288
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.160
The low was early.

1289
01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.020
We came down and took it out.

1290
01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.380
Did the point of control migrate higher?

1291
01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.840
It wasn't able to migrate higher.

1292
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.740
It's a sign that there really isn't a lot of strength in the market.

1293
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.020
Now, remember, we looked at this base.

1294
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.680
Finally, we got down below this base.

1295
01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.040
First time we got rejected.

1296
01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.060
But it's not a healthy structure.

1297
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.280
Higher value.

1298
01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.620
It's moving higher with the trend.

1299
01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.280
Fair to elongate.

1300
01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.400
Why didn't it elongate?

1301
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:33.980
Okay?

1302
01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:37.820
Because more than likely, it's going higher, higher value.

1303
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:40.680
But what's stopping it from elongating?

1304
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:44.280
What is stopping the point of control from migrating higher?

1305
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:52.080
More than likely, it's a longer time frame, being very patient, saying, you bought some.

1306
01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.800
You bought some more.

1307
01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.460
Remember my example of the guy from one of the graining companies in Minneapolis?

1308
01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.600
Come on the grain floor.

1309
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.460
You bought some.

1310
01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.160
It's a nuance.

1311
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.160
And those nuances are very important in the market.

1312
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:14.160
It's very, the market, you start to get a feeling that the market is very, very heavy.

1313
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.800
You get a feeling it's running on vapors.

1314
01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.760
You get a feeling that the risk, the risk is getting to be excessive.

1315
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.980
That is a very poor low, right?

1316
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.120
We saw a low.

1317
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.620
We could have a low with five ticks.

1318
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.380
We could have a low with one tick.

1319
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:30.980
Now, the second tick off of the low is three wide.

1320
01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.800
I wouldn't want to go home.

1321
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:38.100
I wouldn't want to go home long this market for anything.

1322
01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:45.440
If something goes wrong, some anxiety event, it's not going to be able to support it very well.

1323
01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.320
The market's getting very heavy.

1324
01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.460
Let's take a look at what's coming up.

1325
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:58.540
The market down there is heavy, but we saw this slide before, right?

1326
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.360
Even though it looked heavy, was it trading on its own?

1327
01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.260
It wasn't trading on its own.

1328
01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:06.080
Guess what?

1329
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.640
When a market's not trading on its own, I don't want to be involved in the market.

1330
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.800
The risk is too great.

1331
01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.100
There's just too much uncertainty.

1332
01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:16.320
Okay?

1333
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:27.660
Okay, Friday, April 16th, poor high indicates that a market has gotten too long.

1334
01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.340
Remember, early on, I made the point.

1335
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.820
We started off and we talked very simply about buying tails and selling tails, right?

1336
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:44.500
And I said at that point, careful, it's more complex than that.

1337
01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:55.740
I also know that when people first hear about buying tails and selling tails, they want to run out and they want to look for opportunities where they can buy with a buying tail and they can sell with a selling tail.

1338
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.340
They haven't understood the complexity of it.

1339
01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:01.160
And I did make you a promise.

1340
01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:09.220
I made you a promise that as we got through this, it would be more complex and you would start to understand the difficulty.

1341
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:16.280
You would start to understand why somebody in one of the chat rooms said, oh, this is just, it's just too ambiguous.

1342
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.760
It's just too intense.

1343
01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:19.920
It's not for me.

1344
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.820
And that's right.

1345
01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.200
It's not for a lot of people.

1346
01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:34.720
When you get the complexity up here, a poor high, in one sense, we'd say a poor high is indication that the market is not what?

1347
01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.080
It's not completed, right?

1348
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.300
So in one sense, we say, oh, we're going higher.

1349
01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.280
The market's not completed.

1350
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:51.840
But in another sense, and you have to take this in context, if this happens early in a rally or if it happens very late in a rally or a trend,

1351
01:21:52.480 --> 01:22:03.620
now as it happens later and later, if a market gets too long, those that are too long get very, very nervous, just like those that are too short get very nervous.

1352
01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:11.020
So if they get too long and all of a sudden start to get a sense that they're caught, they're going to be selling every high.

1353
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.300
So you get up here, poor highs can also indicate a market has gotten too long.

1354
01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.040
Very confusing, right?

1355
01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:19.880
You say, well, wait a minute.

1356
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.520
In one sense, it says the market's not completed.

1357
01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:31.800
It may be, you may have a situation where the market is not completed for one time frame, but it is completed for another time frame.

1358
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.700
So this may tell us that a next longer time frame, we're not completed.

1359
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.380
But for the shorter time, the market is too long.

1360
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:44.820
Then you combine that, the poor high, you combine that with the point of control not moving higher,

1361
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:50.100
and you start to get more and more evidence that you've got a market that is too long.

1362
01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:55.560
Now, traders will continue to do what works until it doesn't work anymore.

1363
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.560
Now, traders will continue to do what works until it is too long.

1364
01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.800
Buying brakes, they aren't getting much for it.

1365
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.440
Start thinking the diffusion model.

1366
01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:03.200
Okay?

1367
01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:09.020
When you look at a brake like this, up there, all of a sudden, you've got some people selling into the rally.

1368
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.200
More than likely, who are they?

1369
01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.720
They're the innovators, right?

1370
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.780
They're the innovators.

1371
01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.880
Now, the market starts to come down.

1372
01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.920
Another concept I want you to think about.

1373
01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.960
This gets me thinking because you say, well, it didn't pull back very far.

1374
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.700
But you've got a whole lot of longs in there.

1375
01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:31.680
Think drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.

1376
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:37.100
The longer, if you're holding long positions, the longer the market drips on you,

1377
01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:41.260
the longer you don't get the satisfaction of rallying,

1378
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:44.600
the more uncomfortable you get with your long position,

1379
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
the more anxious you become to sell it.

1380
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.360
So now you're selling on the high, you're selling on the high here.

1381
01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:56.340
Even though, remember, you may have a situation where the innovators are doing what?

1382
01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:58.640
Selling.

1383
01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.200
Some early longs are selling.

1384
01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.780
But the momentum traders are still doing buying every what?

1385
01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.280
Buying every break, right?

1386
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.000
So see the dynamics in here.

1387
01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.840
A lot of the momentum traders, now I'm thinking, they'll do what works until it doesn't work anymore.

1388
01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.460
So they're buying every break.

1389
01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.600
They're getting less and less for it.

1390
01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:23.440
The innovators, or those that are longer term, a little long,

1391
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.160
they're going, you bought some, you bought some more.

1392
01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.940
The example that I like to use, and I don't know if this will show up from the video,

1393
01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.160
but I saw somebody do this example years ago.

1394
01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:43.720
So if you take a coin and you spend that coin, you get less and less and less and less and less each time.

1395
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.040
So if you think about that, the buyers are buying every break.

1396
01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.220
They're getting less and less each time.

1397
01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.880
And finally, the last time, they get nothing, right?

1398
01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.900
So they buy, and then they have to turn around and sell immediately.

1399
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.340
It's a process.

1400
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.660
Highs and lows are made via a process.

1401
01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.760
So now they were selling up here.

1402
01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:11.240
We got another day that we're selling at the highs again.

1403
01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.400
Value here is going to be what?

1404
01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.400
Value is going to be lowered.

1405
01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.240
Price and value are going to be lowered.

1406
01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:22.340
Remember, early on, we said this was the top of a spike earlier.

1407
01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:25.000
We got into the spike a little bit the previous day.

1408
01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.240
We're back down into the spike, below the spike.

1409
01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.220
We broke support.

1410
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:30.260
Okay?

1411
01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.520
That's kind of a process that goes on.

1412
01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:34.540
Okay.

1413
01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:37.300
So let's move forward and see what we're looking at.

1414
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:44.900
So the second half of, you see the second half of Friday take place,

1415
01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.920
and you get more of a liquidating break.

1416
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.520
You can see the culmination of that process, right?

1417
01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.120
You see the process.

1418
01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.840
You saw it in profile.

1419
01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.500
You saw the process.

1420
01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:02.620
You saw the cumulative evidence.

1421
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:07.600
You were getting less and less each time as the momentum players were coming in.

1422
01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:13.780
We saw evidence that we saw selling by the innovators.

1423
01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.820
We saw the momentum players still buying every break.

1424
01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:21.180
And finally, it all comes apart.

1425
01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:24.160
A nuance.

1426
01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:30.180
Usually on a big, meaningful break, about, if you've done your references right,

1427
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:38.480
it usually takes about three good, solid references to contain a meaningful break in the marketplace.

1428
01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:46.140
So what we've tried to do, we've tried to walk through some examples that are relatively current,

1429
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.760
tried to give you a feeling of a relatively complicated process,

1430
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.300
tried to give you a feeling of where you saw.

1431
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.280
Clearly, you were seeing conflicting information in here,

1432
01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.320
but yet you saw the final outcome on a break moving pretty sharply.

1433
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.520
Odds-based trading.

1434
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.380
You're continually trying to assess the odds.

1435
01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:14.880
The poor underlying structure coming into Friday had increased the odds against the longs, right?

1436
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.980
It didn't predict the break.

1437
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:19.840
Okay.

1438
01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.220
It didn't predict the break.

1439
01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.660
The poor structure and what was going on.

1440
01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:29.660
But it certainly increased the odds that the conditions were right for something like that to happen.

1441
01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:35.540
We very often will see that a daytime frame auction struggling to trade higher.

1442
01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.280
There's information in that.

1443
01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.200
Structure weakens.

1444
01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.200
Vime declines.

1445
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.900
However, price doesn't decline.

1446
01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.980
But the odds have changed.

1447
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.240
The odds have changed.

1448
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:55.800
So sometimes, even if price doesn't indicate the change, the weakening structure, the lower volume, and all those things will indicate that the odds are changing.

1449
01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.240
We as human beings are not well programmed to think in terms of odds.

1450
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:11.300
It's just not, from all the research I've read, we are just not naturally programmed to be odds-based thinkers.

1451
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:24.000
We take exceptional risks that we never think, I mean, we drive cars on ice, and I live out where everybody's got a four-wheel drive vehicle, and they know that a four-wheel drive vehicle, you can drive any place on snow and ice, right?

1452
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:29.000
And of course, you go by and see them up down, but we're upside down in the road all the time.

1453
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:39.100
We're just not good at odds-based trading, and what I'm trying to get you to think about is, as you transition, think about being an odds-based trader.

1454
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:44.740
Think about cumulative evidence, and how do we get to make intelligent trades?

1455
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:47.180
How do we control our risk?

1456
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.320
Remember, we can control risk.

1457
01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.260
We can't control return.

1458
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:58.280
What I would suggest that you do from here is take this information.

1459
01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.300
We provided you with a workbook.

1460
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:13.600
On a few places in the workbook, I incorporated some things that I thought were relatively important, left space for you to take your own notes,

1461
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.880
and hopefully we added additional information today.

1462
01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.880
It will not come easy, I promise you.

1463
01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:26.660
I will think that the odds are very good if you stick with it.

1464
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.760
You will benefit tremendously from this.

1465
01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:38.860
And as Julia said early on, you will probably never look at the market twice the same way you used to.

1466
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.960
You'll look at it entirely different than you ever thought about looking at it.

1467
01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.080
You probably never thought about excess and balance in the same framework.

1468
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:57.700
Hopefully, what we've done is given you a base from which to begin a whole new way to look, understand markets,

1469
01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:01.380
and to advance your trading career.

1470
01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:10.180
And most of the people we deal with are already professional traders, or their goal is to become serious professional traders.

1471
01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:12.880
I'd like to thank a few people.

1472
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:18.380
Window Trader, owned by Terry Lieberman, provided a lot of the charts.

1473
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.840
Window Trader and CQG.

1474
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.000
CQG is the quote vendor I use, along with Window Trader.

1475
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:32.120
Also, we're very instrumental in providing us with a lot of the charts and the graphs that we use today.

1476
01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:37.420
I really want to thank you very, very much for coming out and spending this time,

1477
01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.860
and have a great trading going forward.

1478
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:41.620
Thanks.

1479
01:30:41.620 --> 01:31:11.600
Thank you.
