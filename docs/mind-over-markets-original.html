Preface

You can manage risk but not return.

—Peter Bernstein

T his book is about gaining an advantage over your competitors.

To achieve this advantage, you must ﬁrst discard the belief that
there is a linear relationship between risk and reward. The primary ob-
jective of investing (and trading) is to identify asymmetric opportunities.To
capitalize on these opportunities, you must learn to identify imbalances
that reveal themselves in evolving market structure. But that is only the
beginning—you must also understand the way you process and respond to
information, so your ability to act is not blocked or distorted by peripheral
inﬂuences.

Markets in Proﬁle: Proﬁting from the Auction Process introduces a
uniﬁed theory that explains the market’s auction process in relation to the
human decision-making process, and the way market behavior affects hu-
man behavior. The bottom line? You are equipped to manage risk, which
puts you miles ahead of the pack.

MARKETS ARE RATIONAL, PEOPLE ARE NOT

The “efﬁcient markets” theory is half right. The market’s mechanism for
allocating prices is extremely fair. It’s a simple two-way auction process
by which price moves over time to facilitate trade either up or down—an
extremely rational, efﬁcient process.

The other half of the efﬁcient market equation, however, is often wrong;
people are seldom rational when they make ﬁnancial decisions. The ﬁrst step
toward more proﬁtable investing is to accept that market irrationality is due
to the fact that people make decisions based on (unavoidably) incomplete
information, which often results in the worst decisions being made when it
is most important to be right.

Human nature is such that we tend to overweight information that sup-
ports our presupposed inclinations. We seek out a few pieces of the bigger

PREFACE

picture that make us feel conﬁdent in our decisions. This recurring over-
conﬁdence is behind the idea that markets are “irrational in a predictable
manner,” a landmark theory put forth by Nobel Prize–winning psychologists
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

But Kahneman and Tversky didn’t take this information to the next
level. They didn’t explore how to take advantage of that fact. In this book,
we show you how the auction process both records and reveals market
structure—and how, within that structure, predictability manifests itself in
recognizable forms such as the “excess” that occurs at the end of an auction.
We show you how excess is formed, too, and how to view it objectively in
order to better manage risk.

All markets alternate between periods of stability and crisis. By mon-
itoring market structure in real-time context, it is possible to recognize
paradigm shifts in equilibrium. Market indicators such as excess make it
possible to identify when the status quo is changing, which results in op-
portunities to distinguish favorable (and unfavorable) investment oppor-
tunities. In other words, it is possible to ameliorate risk by recognizing
imbalances caused by irrational human behavior such as the herd instinct,
which pushes price away from value.

Everyone talks about the problems of investing and market behavior. We
are proposing a solution, a means of interpreting market behavior through
the lens of human consciousness, and then quantifying that information in
a way that enables investing on a more probabilistic basis.

IS THIS BOOK FOR YOU?

Authors’ Note

While this is a collaborative work, the rest of the preface and many of the
experiences shared throughout the book are written from the perspective
of lead author Jim Dalton, who has spent his career furthering his under-
standing and mastery of the markets.

As the lead author, I’m often asked if I’m writing for investors or traders.
I believe such distinctions are in many ways arbitrary for there is no line
where one stops and the other ends. It’s a spectrum, and every individual
and every institution falls on a different point. That point changes constantly
depending on the phase of activity. Even the longest-term investor should
change his decision-making process in order to exit or enter a position. Trim,
add, raise cash, change asset allocation—these are all timing decisions.

In The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell could have been writing about
markets when he described crime as not “a single discrete thing, but a

word used to describe an almost impossibly varied and complicated set of
behaviors.”

Perhaps you’re a growth investor. Or a value investor. Large cap, small
cap—most institutional investors tend to pick a style and stick with it. The
theories in this book are not dependant on the condition of the market, nor
on what style is currently in favor. In fact, much of the power and appeal of
these theories is that they are totally agnostic in terms of style, cap size, and
asset class. The concepts you encounter are equally applicable to any style
of investing, any timeframe, even any market, because the auction process
works equally well for futures, real estate, art, even eBay.

The core idea is simple: all ﬁnancial markets are measurable by time,
price, and volume. This multidimensional approach to interpreting market-
generated information enables you to differentiate between prices, because
all prices are not equal. By extension, all opportunities are not equal, which
is key in managing the probabilities of risk.

THERE IS NO CERTAINTY—THERE ARE
ONLY PROBABILITIES

Markets react to countless inﬂuences other than fundamental company
news. There are natural disasters, terrorist attacks, wars, and political im-
broglios that cause markets to become too long or too short in different time-
frames. It is often the shorter-term uncertainties that can make or break a
money manager, putting sizable divots in the results investors use to choose
fund allocation. One bad quarter can sink a portfolio and mar a stellar ﬁve-
year track record.

Modern portfolio theory depends heavily upon diversiﬁcation by asset
class, sectors, individual securities, and so on. One of the core tenets of this
book is that such diversiﬁcation is not enough—you must also diversify
by timeframe. Timeframe diversiﬁcation is a staple for ﬁxed income man-
agers, who frequently diversify by owning short-, intermediate-, and long-
term instruments. This approach should be natural for equity investors and
investment advisors as well.

Successful timeframe diversiﬁcation can help hedge against the ma-
jor liquidating breaks, short-covering rallies, and other short-term market
movements caused by news events that can push markets to the breaking
point. What I’m getting at is that managers often throw in the towel at exactly
the wrong time. This is undoubtedly why there’s a saying that markets will
trade to levels that cause the most pain for the greatest number of investors.
Change is the great common denominator. When change occurs, we
are most vulnerable, and the natural human tendency is to grasp for what is

PREFACE

familiar, what has “worked” before. That’s why it is so important to learn to
identify the basic structure of change through conscious attention to evolv-
ing market conditions. Recognizing the patterns that precipitate change can
make the difference of a couple hundred basis points. And that, in a highly
competitive world, can be the difference between feast and famine.

An investor or investment advisor who understands that markets do
not change in a linear fashion, and that risk and return must be managed
by interpreting change as it occurs in the present tense, is better able to
recognize and capitalize on risk asymmetries. Ultimately, that is what dis-
tinguishes the successful investor from both the long-only and absolute
schools of thought.

KNOW THE MARKET, KNOW YOURSELF,
MANAGE RISK

The world wants absolute answers. This is why we are being careful to note
that what we are suggesting is not an academic model to replace the efﬁcient
market hypothesis. The conundrum is that mathematics and factor-model
approaches are more consistent than human intuition, but they don’t al-
low for enough ﬂexibility to respond to rapidly changing market situations.
They don’t allow you to distance yourself from competitors who apply sim-
ilar models. It’s like watching the world championship of poker—all the
good players know the odds. That’s why winning takes another level of
understanding.

This book separates the market mechanism from the investor. While it
is possible to describe the workings of any market within a single coherent
framework, that knowledge represents only half of the equation. It is not
enough to grasp how markets work; you must also understand how you
take in and process information, and then execute based on that informa-
tion. This concept has gained currency since “Prospect Theory” established
that we are not rational decision makers. Our emotions can weaken or com-
pletely eliminate our self-control . . . but we’ll save a thorough discussion of
human behavior and neuroeconomics for a later chapter.

We’re simply suggesting that traditional fundamental analysis can be
enhanced with real-time context—time, price, and volume. By interpreting
analysis in relation to market-generated information, the investor can bet-
ter understand the nature of change, which can positively inﬂuence trade
location. Trade location is the key to controlling risk and taking advantage
of asymmetric opportunities that occur within developing market structure.
In recent years, the bifurcation of the brain has been explored thor-
oughly in popular media. We are not the ﬁrst to suggest that successful

investing (or successful anything) incorporates both sides of the brain. The
goal is to balance the analytical hemisphere, made manifest in vital funda-
mental research, with the pattern recognition of the intuitive hemisphere in
a present-tense process.

We’re talking about whole-brained investing—a holistic, context-based
understanding of market activity. As in all things, balance is the key to
success, a concept that will appear throughout this book.

SO WHY LISTEN TO ME?

I’ve spent my entire career in and around the markets. That experience has
resulted in two fundamental beliefs: First, that intelligence and understand-
ing do not necessarily go hand-in-hand, and second, that patience and self
control can be illusory.

I entered the industry nearly 40 years ago as a broker for a major Wall
Street ﬁrm armed with a strong sales record and the belief that my success
depended only on selling the stocks that my research recommended. I was
a good salesman, but I was na¨ıve and inexperienced. I didn’t know it at the
time, but it would take many years of learning and hard work before I could
conﬁdently say that I was consistently making money for myself, my ﬁrm,
and my clients. I have tried to forget the ﬁnancial pain I inﬂicted during
those early years (as well as the psychological pain I endured from failing
to meet my own expectations). Some of that cognitive dissonance resulted
from poor stock selection, but some was from a lack of experience that
kept me from cautioning customers against their own ideas.

When I ﬁrst became a broker, the importance of raising capital was im-
pressed upon me. The job was vital, I was told, because capital “nourishes
our country.” I quickly learned that no one really cares about the capital-
raising function unless they own the company. Clients? They just wanted to
purchase winners and get rich. This realization shaped the central motiva-
tion of my professional career: to independently seek proﬁtable situations
for my clients.

It was made very clear to me at the time, however, that I was expected to
follow the ﬁrm’s research. After all, the research department was comprised
of the brightest minds on Wall Street. During my initial broker-training pro-
gram, an economist who is still widely recognized told us that he wasn’t
interested in buying any stocks that were then available. When I returned
to California after training, that economist was no longer employed by the
ﬁrm. Soon after, a widely respected analyst suggested that there were very
few buy candidates among the stocks that she followed. She was allowed
to keep her position, but was reportedly placed on probation. Around the

same time, which was just prior to the Bear Market of the early 1970s,
I bought some energy and gold stocks, which were proﬁtable for clients,
only to have my commissions rescinded because the stocks I bought were
not on the ﬁrm’s “recommended list.”

I began to observe surprising behavior in some of the stocks that were
purchased from the recommended list. They declined signiﬁcantly follow-
ing higher than expected earnings. I became enamored with the slogan “buy
the rumor, sell the news.” The problem was that it didn’t always work. Over
time I observed that although the analysis of a company was often correct,
the market’s ensuing movement wasn’t always consistent with that analy-
sis. This is where I learned that fundamental analysis enables only a partial
understanding of the bigger picture.

I changed ﬁrms with a big check in hand, as well as the assurance that
the next ﬁrm’s research was superior to that of the prior ﬁrm, and that my
world would turn around. This was during the Bear Market of the 1970s and
the market was on its way down to 500 from 1,000. Nothing worked. Right
near the bottom, I learned how to short stocks and was successful with my
ﬁrst two shorts. The next short was Fannie Mae, which only required 25
percent margin. Do I need to continue?

One of the pivotal experiences in my life began there, at the bottom of
the market: I became interested in buying and writing options. In those days,
the options business was conducted through a series of independent put and
call dealers who matched buyers and sellers in nonfungible transactions.
During this same period, I had another introduction to the early derivatives
markets when Edward O. Thorp, the legendary card counter, trader, and
coauthor of Beat the Dealer and Beat the Market: A Scientiﬁc Stock Market
System, opened an account with me. What his ﬁrm would do was buy stocks
and sell warrants against those stocks, knowing that they would converge
at expiration. My recollection is that their returns were in the 20 percent
range.

In the early 1970s, my experience with options and warrants brought
me a job offer from Joe Sullivan, who was the ﬁrst president of the
ﬂedgling Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). I gave up my mem-
berships on both the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the CBOE to
join Joe. As an executive vice president of the CBOE during its forma-
tive years, I was exposed to the various segments of the securities in-
dustry as well as the hordes of academics who were then conducting re-
search and engaging in ﬁnancial engineering involving options and other
derivatives. During this period, I observed that a lot of ﬁrms and individual
traders that employed single strategies—strategies that were highly suc-
cessful for a while—saw those same strategies implode during economic
crises caused by system abuse and overextension. I began to understand
that no single strategy can work (for long) for all markets; those with

superior results over the longer term were ﬂexible, adaptive to changing
conditions.

I observed how often, at major tops and bottoms, the experts and insti-
tutional investors seemed to share similar beliefs—beliefs that were simply
wrong. I realized that long-term forecasting is unreliable because unfore-
seen events are bound to occur. I came to the conclusion, during these pe-
riods, that being skeptical, value oriented, and independent were far more
important than being with the majority, especially at the extremes.

Even though I began to better understand what it takes to be success-
ful, I was still never comfortable moving against the crowd. We are social
animals after all, longing to belong. We all want to be part of a larger family,
and every decision we make is in some way inﬂuenced by that desire.

In the late 1980s, I was introduced to a new theory, a method of arranging
data that allowed me to see how markets are organized. I met Peter Stei-
dlmayer, who is credited with developing Market Proﬁle® for the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBOT®), a graphical organization of price and time infor-
mation that displays price on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal
axis—the decision support tool for traders used in this book. Peter asked
me if I wanted to sponsor the book that he and Kevin Koy were writing. I
immediately recognized the value of this new concept and delivered a check
for $10,000 to sponsor Markets and Market Logic (Philadelphia: Porcupine
Press, 1986). My son Rob Dalton, Eric Jones, and I then expanded and elabo-
rated on Pete’s work in Mind Over Markets (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1990),
which provides a wealth of tactical trading information. I’m happy to report
that in 2005 Mind Over Markets has been published in a Chinese edition.

After spending several years trading on my own and mentoring other
traders, UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland) Financial Services asked me if
would return for a fourth time and reorganize their nonproprietary hedge
fund business. This resulted in another signiﬁcant pivot point in my career—
as manager of Hedge Fund Research, I was in direct contact with many
premier hedge funds and successful traders.

Having established an efﬁcient process for reviewing hedge funds, my
ﬁrm then offered me the position of director of research for managed ac-
counts, a position that I was responsible for until I retired in August 2005. In
this role, I was exposed not only to hedge funds but also to more traditional
ﬁrms, some of which had upward of a trillion dollars under management.

I was surprised to discover how poor the actual results were for many
of these relative-return ﬁrms, especially on a long-term basis. While some
may have had decent relative returns (within their peer group), the abso-
lute returns were often disappointing. I feel safe in suggesting that most
hedge fund and relative-return managers could signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from
the concepts in this book.

A long time ago, at the beginning of my career, I became the number-one
salesman at IBM by meeting with clients, upsetting their homeostasis and
then giving them a solution to resolve their state of unease. That model is
still working for me today. Markets in Proﬁle offers a new, holistic theory
for market understanding.

For the inquisitive spirit, I believe this book provides the basis for pro-
found insight into a more coherent form of risk management. (And it’s a fun
read.)

Acknowledgments

W e have singled out a few individuals and organizations for having

provided deﬁnitive insight or support; Markets in Proﬁle was born
out of years of teaching, research, and trading.

J. Peter Steidlmayer pioneered the original theories that served as our
continual point of embarkation for both Markets in Proﬁle and our earlier
book, Mind Over Markets.

Brett N. Steenbarger was introduced to us after he read Mind Over Mar-
kets from the world of “protected academic medicine,” as he put it (Brett
was assistant professor of psychiatry and assistant dean of the College of
Medicine, SUNY Health Science Center at Syracuse). Brett wrote us a two-
part response to the book, spanning more than 60 pages, that was heavily
focused on the, you have a healthy understanding of both markets and your
self. Brett connected the structure of the market proﬁle with the ways in
which our brains efﬁciently collect and visualize information. He also intro-
duced us to formative theories on how change occurs in both individuals
and organizations. This well-reasoned response triggered several years of
reading and research that led to a deeper understanding of cognition, behav-
ioral ﬁnance, and neuroeconomics (you will notice that there are far more
references to books relating to these subjects than there are to books that
explicate market mechanics in Markets in Proﬁle). One of the fundamen-
tal keys to successful trading, we believe, is understanding how markets
change people, and how people change markets.

The Only
Constant

It is not necessary to change. Survival is not
mandatory.

—W. Edwards Deming

My ﬁrst car was a used ’49 Chevy. We could pull it into the garage

and change the plugs, set the timing, clean the carburetor and be
on our way. Back then, it was relatively easy to understand engines
and how to keep them running smoothly. Today, if someone asked me to
explain the ﬁrst thing about what’s happening under the hood of my car, I
wouldn’t have a clue.

There’s a parallel between that Chevy and my ﬁrst excursion into the
world of investing. When I became a stockbroker in the late sixties, my
choices were pretty simple: common stocks, preferreds, a few warrants,
limited over-the-counter options, U.S. government treasuries, municipals
and corporate bonds, and cash. While there were mutual funds, they were
extremely limited and many brokerage ﬁrms discouraged brokers from
selling them to customers.

The ﬁnancial markets have moved from simple to complex at a rate
of change that is impossible to fully grasp. This accelerating complexity
has been multiplied by the Internet explosion, global expansion, and myr-
iad other factors, leaving individual traders and investors bewildered and
grasping at narrow fragments of the larger picture, or subscribing to the
beliefs of supposed experts who promise clarity and shelter from the infor-
mation maelstrom. It’s no wonder that the current ﬁnancial atmosphere is
one of continual change and uncertainty.

In his landmark book, The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), Thomas S. Kuhn examines

the way change realigns the “received beliefs” of any given community; be-
cause a community’s participants deﬁne themselves according to the ideas
they share, they often take great pains to defend those ideas. In fact, it’s not
uncommon for this defensive posture to result in the active suppression
of new theories that undermine reigning assumptions. Therefore research,
Kuhn writes, is not about discovering new truths, but rather “a strenuous
and devoted attempt” to force new data into accepted conceptual boxes.

In short, change threatens the very terms with which we identify who

we are (and how we invest our money).

But history has proved that in all things stasis never lasts—eventually
an anomaly arises that is so compelling it cannot be ignored or dismissed
as a “radical theory.” Inevitably, the anomaly unseats the norm, resulting
in a paradigm shift in shared assumptions. These shifts, as Kuhn describes
them, are nothing short of revolutionary.

Paradigm shifts force a community to reconstruct its foundation of be-
lief. Facts are reevaluated. Data are examined through new lenses and, de-
spite vehement resistance by those who refuse to let go of outdated ideas,
the old paradigm is overthrown. A new community is established, and the
“radical theories” are accepted as the new normative establishment.

The cycle of change begins again.
How important is change? Think about the many powerful institutions
and intrepid individuals that once lead the fray and who are now long gone;
those who recognize change early can take advantage of change, those who
can’t overturn their past beliefs get left behind. That pattern repeats itself
endlessly in all human endeavors.

In The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference
(Boston: Little, Brown, 2000), Malcolm Gladwell deﬁned the way people
react to change by classifying them on a spectrum:

innovators : early adopters : early majority :

late majority : laggards

We are going to show you how to use market-generated information
to identify and adapt to change before your competitors—once the major-
ity recognizes that change is occurring, all assymetric opportunity is lost.
This book challenges you to be an innovator, to overturn (change) many
of the assumptions that now guide your perception of economic and mar-
ket conditions. You may be faced with information that runs counter to
the prevailing beliefs of those whom you have trusted for guidance. Daniel
Kahneman said it best: “Resistance is the initial fate of all new paradigms.
Often this resistance is strongest among the institutions responsible for
teaching and upholding the status quo.”

To begin, we address change in the ﬁnancial markets from the broad-
est perspective, which is from the point of view of investors who operate
in the longest timeframe. But it is important to note that this same process

occurs for traders/investors of all timeframes—those who capitalize on
ﬁve-minute price swings, day traders who make several daily decisions,
short-term traders who hold positions for several days, intermediate-term
traders who track bracket extremes, as well traders who hold their posi-
tions for several months or even years.

What we are addressing, across all timeframes, is how change oc-

curs.

We believe that the ﬁnancial markets—and therefore all participants,
businesses, and industries dependent on the markets—are at the vortex of
a truly signiﬁcant change. Over the coming years, investors, traders, portfo-
lio managers, ﬁnancial advisors, pension consultants, and even academics
will all have to pick their spot on the spectrum of change . . . and win or
lose because of it.

There is no single key driver behind the change we’re experiencing.
Rather, a series of developments—some connected and some not—over
the past 30 years have created the evolution that is now underway. The
balance of this chapter introduces these events and their implications on
the ﬁnancial markets and those who operate within them (traders, portfolio
managers, advisors, etc.). To help you visualize the following discussion,

MARKETS IN PROFILE

Figure 1.1 illustrates several key developments of recent market history in
the context of the U.S. equity market.

THE CREATION OF ERISA

The ﬁrst serious change in the modern ﬁnancial services business took
place in the early seventies, partly as a result of the U.S. bear market that
culminated in October 1974. Leading to the trend’s nadir, equity valuation
had decreased by approximately 40 percent (see Figure 1.1), the bond mar-
ket had dropped an equivalent amount, and there was an estimated 35 per-
cent decline in purchasing power. It should come as no surprise that inno-
vation ﬂourished under these extreme conditions; change demands the sur-
render of security, and in 1974 the very notion of security was cast in doubt.
Not surprisingly, new government regulations designed to protect em-
ployees’ hard-earned retirement funds followed closely on the heels of
this cataclysmic plunge. Enter ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Se-
curity Act), enacted in 1974 and designed to protect employee pensions.
While performance measurement had got under way in the 1960s, ERISA
increased focus on return relative to risk, which jumpstarted a new era of
corporate accountability.

While this new accountability was clearly needed, ERISA was con-
cerned more with the process by which pension-investment decisions were
made, rather than with the investments themselves, which had the effect of
ushering in an industry that focused on asset allocation, manager selection,
and performance evaluation. Pension funds began to exercise more pru-
dence when selecting money managers, hiring consultants to assist them
in meeting their ﬁduciary responsibilities. The pension-consulting industry-
began to boom.

On the surface, ERISA had many positives—it improved diversiﬁcation
and disclosure and promoted standards that enabled investors to better un-
derstand and compare investment performance. However, lurking below
the surface was a negative that would take years to fully reveal itself: many
of the processes implemented as a result of ERISA served to stiﬂe innova-
tion and creativity in the investment management business.

THE RISE AND FALL OF RELATIVE
PERFORMANCE

The push toward improved diversiﬁcation and process transparency re-
sulted in managers developing extremely speciﬁc approaches to investing
(see Figure 1.2). In turn, consultants needed improved ways to judge how

individual managers were performing relative to the market, and relative
to each other. Consultants initially used broad markets indices to gauge
performance. However, as more and more specialty managers began to ap-
pear, benchmarks began to evolve and, as with all change, these evolutions
became increasingly complex. Specialized market indexes were employed
to gauge performance. Categories were formed so that managers could
be compared against their peers. Consultants pigeonholed asset managers
into distinct styles so they could more easily monitor their activity and
ﬁre them (or not hire them) if they didn’t ﬁt neatly into preconceived cate-
gories. Over time, this forced many money managers to become highly spe-
cialized, focusing on individual styles like growth or value, which in turn
were further broken down into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap strate-
gies, as well as a host of other variations.

Throughout the Great Bull market that began in 1982 and ran for al-
most 20 years, managers that attempted to be creative and innovative
sometimes found that their ability to raise assets diminished—even if they
had stellar track records—because they no longer ﬁt within a convenient
category.

The perceived institutional need to compare performance to peers and
market benchmarks resulted in most of the focus being on relative perfor-
mance, rather than absolute performance. (In short, “relative return” has
to do with how an asset class performs relative to a benchmark, such as
the S&P 500. “Absolute return” speaks to the absolute gain or loss an asset
or portfolio posts over a certain period.) The relativistic approach to eval-
uating performance proved to be a boon for asset managers, in that they
could now focus on constructing portfolios that had only to equal or per-
form marginally better than market benchmarks—regardless of whether
performance was positive or negative.

Relativism provided a windfall for asset managers, in that it often
masked poor absolute performance; an asset manager with a negative

chapter01

return could still win the Boeing pension fund simply by outperforming
peers and benchmarks! As long as performance was measured on a rela-
tive basis, the money management industry continued to raise signiﬁcant
assets (upon which fees could be charged). While this wasn’t so detrimen-
tal during the rising markets of the time, the relative-performance crutch
did little to prepare managers to compete in the less certain markets that
followed the end of the great bull market in 2000.

The tide would soon turn: Once it was clear that the market was no
longer going up, clients would begin to demand that their managers do
more than simply match the market.

THE FALL OF THE GREAT BULL

Coupled with an extended bull market, the enactment of ERISA had the
effect of codifying modern portfolio theory (MPT) in the eyes of the major-
ity of investors and investment managers. (In a nutshell, MPT emphasizes
that risk is an inherent part of higher reward, and that investors can con-
struct portfolios in order to optimize risk for expected returns.) For ﬁdu-
ciaries, the concept of controlled risk through diverse asset allocation is
certainly appealing. When markets are “behaving” (as they were for nearly
two bullish decades) the return, risk, and correlation assumptions used to
generate asset allocation analyses tend to sync relatively well with market
activity; a trend is predictable as long as it continues. In this environment,
modern portfolio theory became the comfortable thread that held the ﬁ-
nancial markets’ complex patchwork quilt together. Within this model, as-
set managers that performed well on a relative basis within a single, easily
identiﬁable style could consistently raise assets. Once they stepped away
from their advertised style, however, their opportunities became limited.
An unfortunate result of this phenomenon was that this narrow, restrictive
environment tended to limit the growth of asset managers’ skill base. It’s
difﬁcult to understand how talented, competitive individuals allowed them-
selves to remain locked into one speciﬁc management style for so long,
especially when that style had clearly fallen out of favor. I saw managers
literally go out of business rather than change their investment approach.
As the great bull began to show signs of strain and the equity markets
began to behave with far less certainty (no longer trending up). It became
apparent that the relativistic, MPT-driven business model embraced by tra-
ditional asset managers—one in which money was managed on a relative
basis, track records were marketed based on relative performance, and
performance was measured in relative terms—was plagued by signiﬁcant
weaknesses.

Alexander M. Ineichen of Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) estimated
that total global equity peaked at a little over $31 trillion at the top of the
bull market, falling to approximately $18 trillion at the 2002 low—a decline
of approximately 42 percent. As during the 1974 period, the investment
community reluctantly began to embrace change in order to cope with the
divide that opened between the objectives of traditional money managers
and the needs of their clients.

One of the prime causes for this divide was that MPT depends on “rea-
sonable” assumptions for each asset class. Implicitly, this requires a very
long-term view; investors must plan on holding their investments for a long
time in order to reap the desired rewards. Unfortunately, when markets
failed to cooperate toward the end of the bull market, it became evident
that most individuals and institutions have a vastly different perspective of
what “long-term” means, especially when short-term performance is on the
line. During times of market stress, the correlations between asset classes
often fall apart, which often results in unexpectedly poor performance.

THE RISE OF ABSOLUTE RETURN

There appears to be a dearth of insight into how investors respond when
the shorter timeframe delivers signiﬁcantly different results than was ad-
vertised and expected for the longer term. But there is no lack of evidence
that long-term-minded investors, when confronted with unexpectedly
poor short-term results, tend to liquidate their holdings at precisely the
wrong time.

As the markets became more volatile and uncertain, traders and
investors who had broken free of the relativistic herd, embracing an
absolute-return philosophy, continued to produce positive returns at a
time when the majority of traditional asset managers were posting consis-
tently negative returns (along with the market). Because absolute-return
investors measure themselves against the risk-free rate, rather than rela-
tive to a market index, they must be more ﬂexible and nimble. They must
have the ability to employ a much broader arsenal of investment strate-
gies in order to achieve their goal of delivering consistently positive per-
formance. This group can employ all styles across all capitalizations. They
can also short securities, which creates even more opportunities and en-
ables portfolio managers to exploit both overpriced as well as underpriced
securities.

The end of the great bull served as the catalyst for a much more adven-
turous and entrepreneurial environment. In today’s atmosphere, it’s harder
for the traditional money management ﬁrms to hold on to talented traders

chapter01

and portfolio managers, as the ﬁnancial rewards for stepping out solo can
be extremely large for truly capable individuals. The ﬁrms that want to sur-
vive and prosper in the absolute-return milieu must adapt and ﬁnd new in-
centives for attracting and retaining such innovators. An article in a leading
U.K. newspaper, the Observer, reported that Dillon Read Capital Manage-
ment, the new hedge fund unit established by UBS in 2005, earmarked $1
billion in bonuses for its ﬁrst three years in business to ensure that it con-
tinued to attract and retain successful traders. When the article appeared,
there were only about 120 employees in that unit, which would work out,
on average, to about $3 million per employee. It’s no wonder that we con-
tinue to see a steady exodus of portfolio managers from the traditional
asset management ﬁrms toward those organizations that offer more chal-
lenging opportunities in the new world of absolute return.

SUCCEEDING IN AN ABSOLUTE RETURN
MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Following a strong rise or bubble, markets historically remain within
bracketing ranges for many years. As most equity markets peaked in early
2000, we are in the ﬁfth year of a bear market at the time of this writing.
Although the term “bear,” in this context, is misleading, it is more useful to
think of current conditions as indicative of a “consolidating,” “trading,” or
“bracketing” market. The high-to-low range of a consolidating market of-
fers excellent opportunities for traders who are adaptable enough to trade
them. John Mauldin, in Bull’s Eye Investing: Targeting Real Returns in
a Smoke and Mirrors Market (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2005),
states that the shortest bear on record is eight years, with the average be-
ing 16 years. During these periods, it seems as if the market’s actions are
guided by some shrewd NFL offensive coordinator—just when it looks like
the market is going long it pulls up short, jukes left and rolls right, leaving
a pile of stunned investors in its wake.

Consolidating markets are tricky. Just when you think you’ve got them
ﬁgured out, you end up the wrong way on a big move and you feel like
you’ve been betrayed by everything you know. Many traders begin to think
of the market as a cunning adversary who tries to foil their best-laid plans,
or perhaps a tempting siren, bent on luring them to the bottom of their
bank accounts.

In a long-term bull market, or a “relative-return market,” you can suc-
ceed by simply staying fully invested and matching the market’s steady
rise. In a bear, or consolidating market, such as the one we’re in now,
savvy traders seek to identify and proﬁt from mispriced securities, both on
the long as well as short side of the market. Achieving “absolute returns”

(returns that consistently exceed the risk-free rate, regardless of market
direction) requires skill, self-knowledge, an understanding of market and
investor behavior, and trading maturity. The point here is that the relative
and absolute approaches exist at opposite ends of the spectrum, and brack-
eting market conditions reward absolute-return investors—those individu-
als who are concerned with the value of their portfolios at every point in
time, not just at some predetermined maturation (see Figure 1.3).

If history continues to repeat itself, as it has for the past ﬁve years,
then the 20-year bull run will fade farther into the past, and a substantially
different approach to market understanding will be required to consistently
succeed.

It is worth noting here that Mind over Markets, the ﬁrst collaboration
between these authors, was written in the middle of the great bull market,
when most investors had already climbed aboard the relative-return train.
The theories and practices prescribed in that book are as applicable to-
day as they were then—there is still unexpected volatility in bull markets,
and Mind over Markets provided a detailed treatise on taking advantage of
such volatility. Since the great bull, market mechanics and human behavior

have not changed, although much around them has. With the proliferation
of hedge funds, for example, there is more short-term momentum trading,
which means that markets tend to move faster and go further once a move-
ment has started.

But bull or bear or bracket, markets always conform to the fundamen-
tal dictates of time, price, and volume. We’ll revisit some of the principles
set forth in Mind over Markets within new context in this book.

PURE, UNBIASED INFORMATION

As you have already surmised, the volatility of consolidating markets is
generally far greater than that experienced in bull markets. This increased
volatility provides both risk and opportunity. Traders who are ruled by
their emotions (or led by nearsighted analysts) will continue to chase up-
ward swings and bail out on downward swings, which results in temporar-
ily mispriced securities, as well as the ﬁnancial destruction suffered by
those who get whipsawed. This progression between bracket extremes
provides prime opportunities to take advantage of ﬂeeting discrepancies
between price and value.

Markets in Proﬁle is in large part dedicated to explicating this phe-
nomenon in the clear light of market-generated information—not the del-
uge of hype and conﬂicting information that serves only to fuel the emo-
tional panic behind most market movement. Those individuals who have
the trifecta of market experience, self understanding, and skill can avoid
the classic “panic in/panic out” whipsaw and take advantage of those who
don’t. Absolute-return investing is a zero-sum game, with a few highly
skilled professionals taking from those who run, generally terriﬁed, with
the pack.

Who are those few? They are investment professionals with the experi-
ence to take a long-term view while capitalizing on short-term inequities in
market structure; those who understand their own foibles, so they don’t fall
prey to the slings and arrows of doubt, anger, and fear; those who have the
discipline to focus solely on relevant, market-generated information while
the data explosion rages on around them.

Market-generated information is the pure, unbiased information that
comes directly from the market itself. Structuring and interpreting this
information is an excellent way to get a truly objective opinion about
what’s driving market movement, as it’s based solely upon real order ﬂow.
Market-generated information represents a composite of all available infor-
mation at any given moment—from macro and micro. And by organizing
this information using the CBOT’s Market Proﬁle, you can monitor market

structure in real-time context, which enables you to recognize paradigm
shifts in equilibrium. When there is symmetry to market structure (as
shown in Figure 1.4), which manifests itself in a traditional bell-shaped
curve, then there is generally a balance between good opportunities and
bad.

When the market proﬁle becomes asymmetric (as shown in Figure 1.5),
then there is a lack of balance, which results in opportunities to distinguish
favorable (and unfavorable) investment opportunities.

Structuring and reading market-generated information via CBOT’s
Market Proﬁle is about identifying opportunities where risk is considerably

less than the potential reward. Asymmetric opportunities are often caused
by irrational human behavior, such as the herd instinct that pushes price
away from value. We’ll delve more deeply into using the Market Proﬁle tool
and behavioral ﬁnance (often referred to as neuroeconomics) in later chap-
ters. The point is that having a reliable, objective information source be-
comes more important every day. Markets continue to exhibit overwhelm-
ing, ever-increasing complexity, driven by growing diversity, globalization,
technological advances, an increasing numbers of participants, and almost
limitless outside factors that result in constant change. The remainder of
this book is about how you can better understand and interpret the most
objective source of information—the market itself.

PEOPLE CHANGE MARKETS, MARKETS
CHANGE PEOPLE

Change is the beating heart of this book. Markets in Proﬁle addresses the
nature of change as it relates to markets and market participants of every
type and timeframe, from macro to micro, from large institutions to in-
vestors who hold positions for decades and traders who roll with the mar-
ket’s daily vacillations. Everything in this book is equally applicable to indi-
vidual traders, money management organizations, the proprietary trading
units of major ﬁnancial organizations, and all the newly formed alternative-
investment shops.

For all market participants, the ﬁnancial world has changed dra-
matically in the last
two decades. This change can work to your
advantage—most practitioners have either failed to recognize this change,
or, more likely, have chosen not to adapt, blinded by the assumption (or the
desperate hope) that what has worked in the past will continue to work in
the future.

Your second, and more important advantage, is that despite the aston-
ishing rate of change in the investment world, the fundamentals of market
activity are just as they have always been: price and volume move over time
to facilitate trade in the pursuit of value. It really is that simple.

It is the belief of the authors that in order to better manage risk, you
must ﬁrst understand the ways in which people change markets, and the
ways in which markets change people. We will endeavor to investigate the
nature of change, starting with a general discussion of perceived paradigms
and culminating in a close look at the speciﬁcs of securing favorable trade
location in the active, endlessly changing market.

On a ﬁnal note, Markets in Proﬁle is also about addressing what could

be your greatest adversary: yourself.

Information

There are relatively simple changes in the pre-
sentation and structuring of information that can
make a big difference in how much of an impact it
makes.

—Malcolm Gladwell, The Tipping Point

I n Chapter 1, we discussed the central role change plays for all mar-

ket participants. We suggested that people change markets, and mar-
kets change people. Let us now turn our attention to information—the
byproduct of change, the ubiquitous evidence that change is, as they say,
the only constant.

Information has no power until someone acts on it. There are as many
responses to any given piece of information as there are humans who re-
ceive it; we all ﬁnd ourselves somewhere on the long continuum between
“leader” and “follower,” in every endeavor. To illustrate the importance of
this concept, consider what would happen if you were to simultaneously
share a perfect investment idea with ﬁve different people. One of those ﬁve
might act immediately, without requiring further evidence, while each of
the remaining four would act in successively later time periods, waiting to
see proof that the idea was, in fact, generating proﬁts. The diffusion model,
made popular by author Malcolm Gladwell in The Tipping Point: How Lit-
tle Things Can Make a Big Difference (Boston: Little, Brown, 2000), would
label each of these individuals as innovators, early adopters, early majority,
late majority, or laggards. These ﬁve archetypes can help us better under-
stand the way the various timeframes’ interactions inﬂuence the market’s
auction process. We’ll discuss this interplay at length in a later chapter, but

ﬁrst, let’s explore the two predominant types of information that affect the
behavior of all investors: fundamental and market-generated information.

FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION

Fundamental information includes a broad array of different types, from
the esoteric, like Kondratieff waves and S-curves, to basic demographic
data and big picture business cycle research. Fundamental information can
also provide insight into the expansion of price earnings multiples dur-
ing secular bull market cycles, as well as the compression of price earn-
ings during secular bear markets. This kind of information reveals that
good earnings don’t necessarily lead to higher stock prices—some of the
strongest market advances have occurred during periods of relatively poor
earnings growth. Then of course there is fundamental information on sec-
tors, industries, and individual companies that shows earnings, sales, mar-
gins, growth rates, and the list goes on.

To make matters more complex, there have been numerous studies
that reveal that fundamental information must be viewed in the right con-
text to have any relevance. For example, a 5 percent yield on the bench-
mark 10-year Treasury note is viewed from one perspective if the yield has
fallen from 7 percent, but viewed from a totally different perspective if the
rate has just climbed to 5 percent after having been as low as 3.5 percent.
It’s all about context.

Let’s take a real-world example that illuminates the importance of con-
text in interpreting information. A few years after the markets peaked in
early 2000, the economy showed signs of reduced inﬂation and slower
growth for several months running, which caused the experts to begin talk-
ing about recession or perhaps “worse” (there were constant references
to Japan, which had recently suffered just such a depression). When the
market began to shows signs of inﬂation in late 2004 and early 2005, it
was generally considered to be good news, as the moderate inﬂation in-
dicated that we were not, after all, likely to slip into a recession. Then
in late 2005, bonds again rallied on economic news that suggested in-
ﬂation was well contained and that real returns were in focus. It’s all
about context. A ﬁsh looks pretty silly ﬂopping around on the dock, but
that same motion—in the context of water—results in graceful, powerful
movement.

In addition to the larger economic environment at any given mo-
ment, which dictates whether inﬂation is considered good or bad news,
there is also personal context to be considered—that is, information may

chapter02

17

be viewed differently depending upon an investor’s “timeframe” (such
as scalper, day trader, short-term trader, intermediate-term trader, and
long-term investor). A company’s reported earnings may be positive when
viewed from a long-run perspective, but short-term traders might take
the same news to be negative due to dashed hopes for even higher
numbers.

Countless articles have been written that support the value of funda-
mental research. But articles have also been published that suggest the
same research is so ﬂawed and biased that it actually has a negative effect
on performance. Because of this common bifurcation, it is important to dis-
tinguish between the accuracy of thoughtful research and the ability of that
research to predict future securities prices. A piece of fundamental analy-
sis may be absolutely correct—an analyst may have accurately analyzed a
company’s earnings—but the market may respond to that information in
a completely unexpected way. Of course, that doesn’t mean the analysis
is bad. Firms that produce fundamental research often produce that re-
search for noninvestment purposes, or from the perspective of a different
timeframe, or for institutional clients who use the information to generate
new business. They’re not soothsayers, however, despite what many might
wish to believe.

Nobel Prize–laureate Daniel Kahneman sums up context this way:
“People don’t assign the correct weights to information, and they assign
too much weight to information, especially if they have collected it them-
selves.” Due to the information glut available to everyone who trades, it is
nearly impossible to view all incoming information in the “correct context,”
especially considering the short-term focus that seems to be pervasive to-
day. As a result, information can be used to make just about any point, or
justify any position one wishes to make.

A much publicized example of the inherent challenges of understand-
ing fundamental information is commonly known as the Greenspan co-
nundrum. In 2005, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan
Greenspan, failed to comprehend why ﬁxed income securities didn’t re-
act as expected to the multiple rate hikes he initiated during the previ-
ous year. Of course, there was no shortage of experts deriding him for
this oversight—after the fact. During this same period, the ﬁxed income
trading results of many of the largest and most respected ﬁnancial ser-
vice ﬁrms were negatively affected by the same conundrum. The experts
expected the ﬁxed income market to behave a certain predictable way
and positioned their books accordingly, but it didn’t. One of the primary
goals of this book is to explain how market-generated information can
help you navigate through “conundrums” like the one that ﬂummoxed Mr.
Greenspan and many of his contemporaries.

RATIONAL OR IRRATIONAL?

Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that investors are not only irrational,
but that they’re predictably irrational. But is “irrational” really the right
term for this behavior? Imagine you’re at the track. You’ve gone over all
the odds, read the expert’s opinions, and completed your own analysis,
which is of course inﬂuenced by myriad factors, like the fact that one of
the horses shares a name with your alma mater, and another happens to
have placed in his last three races. You make your wager before the race
starts and settle in to watch the horses run.

What if we changed the rules and let you place your bet after the race
is already under way? A totally different side of human psychology would
be revealed. Once again, all information must be placed within its proper
context—how will your decision be affected if the horse you had planned
to bet on is currently in the lead? What if the horse is losing momentum
around the second turn? How will your betting habits be affected by this
real-time information?

We should expect, considering a general understanding of human na-
ture, that the larger the horse’s lead, the more individuals will place bets
on that horse to win, and that bets on the horse in the back of the pack will
evaporate. When you extrapolate this behavior in the context of ﬁnancial
markets, is it really so “irrational”? When you think about it, betting on a
clear winner is a pretty rational decision, in the immediacy of the moment.
This phenomenon is commonly known as “momentum investing,” which is
often the primary force behind short-term market movement. And just as
the payoff odds decrease in a betting pool as more money is placed upon a
particular entry, the payoff odds decrease for late-momentum investors as
the market explores price extremes.

The racetrack vignette was meant to illustrate the ways in which mar-
kets can change people’s actions. But there is one important difference
between the track and ﬁnancial markets: The horse race has a speciﬁed
beginning and end, whereas ﬁnancial market movements are never end-
ing. In such a continuously evolving environment, the human behavior de-
scribed above can provide opportunities for both “momentum” and “value”
investors. (Value investors, on the long side of the market, seek securi-
ties that are undervalued relative to certain criteria, which may mean low
price-earning multiples, low price-to-book value, large amounts of cash,
etc.). We’ll explore these opportunities at length later in the book.

Irrational or not, market behavior is the sum total of the actions of
all of its individual participants and disciplines and timeframes. It is in-
ﬂuenced by the conﬂuence of innumerable information sources and the

chapter02

19

whims of human nature. There are very few individual or institutional
investors that aren’t affected by this fantastically complex convergence,
and it is extremely difﬁcult to gain an advantage in today’s markets, domi-
nated as they are by a short-term orientation.

MARKET-GENERATED INFORMATION

The premise of this book is that market-generated information, when
combined with fundamental information, can provide that elusive advan-
tage. Market-generated information is information gained from observing
the actual ﬂow of orders within the market’s present-tense context. Mak-
ing sense of this source of information begins by recognizing that markets
are constantly moving from low to high and high to low. This two-way auc-
tion process enables all market participants to express their opinions—no
matter how those opinions were obtained—with real money; the auctions
effectively establish a fair price where business can be conducted at any
given time. This expression of the market’s collective will results in a con-
stant ﬂow of objective market-generated information.

In order to manage this information, as we mentioned in the preface
to this book, we employ the Chicago Board of Exchange’s trader support
tool called Market Proﬁle. Market Proﬁle is not a trading system, nor is
it predictive. Market Proﬁle simply allows you to observe the structure of
the market as it unfolds, enabling a more accurate interpretation of which
timeframe is in control of market movement. This concept of timeframe
control will be a recurring theme throughout Markets in Proﬁle.

The market, as we have said, is the manifestation of all possible in-
ﬂuences, all news sources, all global and political events, and all market
participants. As the market’s continuous auctions unfold, a market pro-
ﬁle enables us to experience a composite of all available information (and
opinions), because it is solely based on real order ﬂow. Market-generated
information, when properly organized and understood, can greatly demys-
tify the endless complexity of the market. Such data can uncover vital infor-
mation about what is driving change by providing clues that help unravel
the strength or weakness of market momentum.

To establish the signiﬁcance of an objective means of interpreting mar-
ket activity, let’s revisit the potential pitfalls inherent in relying solely on
fundamental information. Suppose that an analyst performs methodical,
well-informed research on a company and comes to the conclusion that
the company is well positioned for strong growth in the next quarter. But
what this fundamental information may not reveal is whether the price of
that company’s stock has already moved to reﬂect that fact. Or perhaps

chapter02

the industry within which the company operates is on the verge of col-
lapse, and nobody is interested in the sector as a whole. The positive re-
port may be meaningless unless viewed in the proper context. Think of the
numerous factors that must all line up to make fundamental information
relevant. Even the slightest miscalculation can result over time in serious
investment consequences. Of course, investors and money managers must
be aware of fundamental indicators, but wouldn’t it make sense to employ
an objective means of ensuring those indicators are actually resulting in
the expected market activity?

Let’s say you bought shares of a good company that had an under-
priced stock—you bought value—but the price has remained basically ﬂat
for an extended period of time. This is not uncommon, and is why many
investors wait to invest until price momentum validates their buy deci-
sion. By using the Market Proﬁle tool, one can often discover conﬁrm-
ing information (positive or negative) in the market structure before it is
reﬂected in signiﬁcant price movement. Securing good trade location—or
being able to exit a bad trade earlier—is the advantage we were discussing
earlier.

Before we provide a mechanical description of market proﬁle con-
struction, let’s ﬁrst deﬁne “trading,” which in the context of this discus-
sion is no different than “investing.” Trading is the anticipation, timing, and
placement of orders to capitalize on change—no matter how short- or long-
term the underlying investments.

THE AUCTIONS

Auctions are made up of three fundamental elements: price, time, and vol-
ume. Price is simply the auction’s means of advertising opportunity. Time
regulates each opportunity, and volume measures the degree of success
of each auction. As with any auction, there are goods for sale, bidders at-
tempting to buy, and sellers trying to sell. While price is the mechanism
used to fairly distribute goods among participants, the skew of volume and
prices enables us to see how willing or unwilling the participants were to
either acquire or give up their holdings; some will be willing to relinquish
their goods at fair value, while others will only enter the auction process if
they perceive price to be away from fair value. As in all successful ﬁnancial
endeavors, it quickly becomes clear that not all prices are equal, and that
identifying the “fair value” consensus is pivotal in understanding the under-
lying forces at work in any given market (Warren Buffett has been saying
this for years). A market proﬁle, by its very nature, helps identify price in
relationship to value.

FAIR VALUE

21

Fair value is deﬁned as the price levels that are attracting the greatest
volume of trade. As you will see as we progress, fair value has different
relevance for different timeframes. Markets are generally “fair” only in the
day timeframe, and what is considered fair in the day timeframe is often un-
fair from a longer point of view. As the market’s two-way auction process
unfolds, there is an ongoing search for information between buyers and
sellers (much the same way that manufacturers and distributors continu-
ally seek information about each other to maximize proﬁts). Once either
party perceives an advantage, they will attempt to move price away from
fair value in order to increase proﬁt. This attempted divergence is constant,
and the market proﬁle records the resulting auctions via a histogram, or
distribution curve.

Historically, scientists have employed the histogram to organize data
so that it can be observed and better understood. As Peter Bernstein estab-
lishes in his book Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk (New
York: John Wiley & Sons, 1998), “The normal curve, or bell curve, enabled
the evolution of human civilization” by providing a means of determining,
statistically, the potential risk and reward intrinsic in any venture (such as
opening a trade route to the West Indies).

A market proﬁle histogram is created through the ongoing develop-
ment of the market’s information-discovery system—its continuous two-
way auction process that advertises price in order to distribute volume in
a fair and competitive manner. The volume, or bidding activity, determines
whether or not divergences from value can be sustained. On one day, sell-
ers are discouraged by prices below value, and buyers are discouraged by
prices above value. When both sides have essentially established a “value
area,” any movement away from value will serve to shut off the ﬂow of auc-
tion activity until price returns to equilibrium. This is commonly known as
reversion to the mean. On another day, the same market may ﬁnd that di-
vergences from value—higher or lower prices—actually attract more vol-
ume rather than shutting it off, which forces participants to reassess their
idea of value (investors who trade via reversion to the mean will be un-
able to sustain proﬁtability when divergences from value are successful).
We demonstrate how knowledgeable, Proﬁle-experienced traders can per-
ceive both situations while markets are unfolding by observing the Proﬁle’s
graphic depiction of the relationship between time, price, and volume—the
true fundamentals of market behavior.

In the discussion above, we referred to the day timeframe; however,
the same theory applies to all timeframes. While we have not yet described
these timeframes, we have referred to them as scalpers, day timeframes,

chapter02

short-term timeframes, intermediate-term timeframes, and the long-term
timeframe.

MARKET PROFILE FUNDAMENTALS

Authors’ Note

The following section contains a very brief discussion of market proﬁle
construction. For a detailed discussion on market proﬁle construction
and mechanics, please refer to Mind over Markets and other texts men-
tioned throughout this book and in the References.

The construction of a histogram requires a constant and a variable.
Market Proﬁle treats time as a constant, placing it on the horizontal axis,
with price, the variable, arranged on the vertical axis. You can construct
a market proﬁle graphic using any time interval, and any liquid ﬁnancial
market. For demonstration purposes, we’ve chosen to represent the day-
timeframe auction, which we’ve broken down into 30-minute intervals,
each of which is assigned a letter. As the market passes through various
price points, the letter designating the current time period appears beside
those prices. Over time, the letters (known as time-price opportunities
or TPOs) accumulate, creating a graphic view of the day’s distribution
curve. Once again, this concept is the same for any of the timeframes men-
tioned above.

Figure 2.1 shows a relatively balanced market forming a fairly typi-
cal bell curve. There is an accumulation of prices (greater volume) at the
center of the distribution, and diminishing accumulation (less volume) at
the extremes. As you become familiar with the way market proﬁle evolves
over time, you can begin to visualize the completion of the histogram—and
how best to trade it—prior to the day’s completion. To effectively trade the
market represented in Figure 2.1, a reversion-to-the-mean strategy would
be most appropriate, as it’s clear that there is consensus in the market re-
garding value (highlighted below by the bracket).

Figure 2.2 shows the same proﬁle, only we have kept each time interval

distinct, so you can see where the market moved during each period.

In addition to day-timeframe distributions, experienced investors also
view proﬁles that cover longer timeframes in order to maintain a clear
long-term perspective of market activity. A longer-term histogram reveals
whether the intermediate auction is occurring within the context of a
bracketing or trending market. A bracketing market—also referred to as
a balancing, range-bound, trading, or sideways market—consists of sev-
eral days with overlapping ranges. Trending markets show much less ten-
dency to overlap, as price and value areas consistently trend up or down.

We will expand on the relationship between price and value as we move
forward.

One of the most important, yet challenging market assessments that
investors wrestle with is determining whether a market is bracketing or
trending. To make this determination even more of a challenge, it is also
true that brackets and trends are largely timeframe dependent. A trend to
a scalper is of no consequence to the long-term investor. An upward trend
to a day-timeframe trader may simply be a series of thirty minute time peri-
ods with higher highs and higher lows; however, for the intermediate-term
trader this activity is considered non-trending, as the activity remains well
contained within the middle quadrants of the intermediate-term bracket or
trading range. A trend for the intermediate-term trader may be a move be-
tween the extremes of a larger trading rang, with no longer-term trend, as
the market remains balanced from a long-term perspective. Context, con-
text, context.

The value area mentioned previously, a fundamental element of the
market proﬁle, is deﬁned as the range of prices that includes 70 percent of
all TPOs in a proﬁle—the prices that saw the most activity, as witnessed
by the greatest accumulation of individual time-period letters. The value
area is determined by starting with the price that resulted in the greatest
volume—the longest horizontal line—then summing the volume occurring
at the two prices directly above the high-volume price and comparing it
to the sum of the two prices below. The dual-price total with the highest
volume becomes part of the value area. This process then continues until
the volume is accounted for. Figure 2.3 illustrates
70 percent of
this process.

Notice that the value area represents approximately one standard devi-
ation. This distinction enables you to distinguish price from value, the most
fundamental principle of investing. When price occurs within the value
area, price and value are considered to be the same. When price occurs
outside the value area, price is considered to be away from value. Regard-
less of your timeframe, as price moves away from the value area, there
will either be acceptance of the move—witnessed by TPOs accumulating
at the new level, which effectively changes the shape of Proﬁle and shifts
the value area—or rejection, in which case price will return to the value
area with little change in the volume distribution. Trends occur when price
movements result in value-area migration. Bracketing markets are revealed
when price movements continually revert to a consistent value area, con-
taining price within well-deﬁned parameters that can last for months.

Figure 2.4 (see page 26) shows the S&P 500 futures contract pro-
ﬁle from November 21, 2005, through December 29, 2005—a 27-day,
intermediate-term trading bracket that ranged from 1257.50 to 1284.70.
During this period, the market completed ﬁve legs that traversed from low

lowed by a partial break and rally, and ﬁnally a high-to-low break that led
to a downward spike on the ﬁnal trading day of 2005.

Inspection of the proﬁle in Figure 2.4 reveals that the longest horizontal
line—which represents the highest volume—occurred in the lower portion
of the proﬁle. Recalling how we calculated the value area, by summing
the volume both above and below the high volume area (referred to as
the point of control, or POC), you will see that the POC was moving lower
over the course of the 27 days, which signiﬁes that the value area was being
forced lower. Without the multidimensional view (time, price, and volume),
what was really occurring in this market might have been masked by hype;
the experts, especially the CNN analysts, were all reporting high odds for
a Santa Claus rally—deﬁned as the trading period between Christmas and
New Year’s. You couldn’t turn on the television without seeing some pundit

announcing the inevitable rally. But if such a rally were really imminent, the
point of control should have been rising, not falling. Volume, as revealed
through the Market Proﬁle, was indicating a consensus that said something
altogether different than what the “experts” were predicting.

DEMYSTIFYING MARKET BEHAVIOR

The Market Proﬁle is a powerful tool for capturing the structure of the mar-
ket as it is being built. While Figure 2.1 resembles a normal bell curve, Fig-
ure 2.4 reveals a volume that skews toward the bottom of the proﬁle. Price
alone cannot distinguish between a market in which movements away from
value will be retraced, versus a market that is transitioning from bracketing
to trending or from trending to bracketing. Sophisticated traders—deﬁned
as those that survive and prosper over the long haul—quickly adapt to dif-
ferent strategies depending on the bracket/trend bifurcation. Investors that
incorporate market-generated information effectively increase the odds
that they can determine whether the current market action is occurring
within the context of an intermediate or longer-term bracket, or as part
of a trend. The strategies for each of these two types of markets are quite
different, which we will discuss at length in later chapters.

In order to identify change early enough to act, you must be creative,
ﬂexible, and innovative when you process information. You have to be able
to interpret the fundamentals of market activity in a way that keeps your
head clear of the deluge of conﬂicting information. Any individual or or-
ganization that hopes to be consistently successful must continue to learn
and develop fresh approaches to investing, always questioning the status
quo, reviewing standard practices, and extending their knowledge base.

The Market Proﬁle, which is entirely process driven, provides an objec-
tive, visual structure to market activity that reﬂects the embodiment of the
actions of all timeframes and market participants. Once you have learned
to read and interpret this proﬁle, it becomes possible to demystify market
behavior. You can gain a signiﬁcant advantage over the competition by bet-
ter understanding and capitalizing on the market’s reaction to fundamental
information—before the market reacts and opportunity is lost.

Timeframes

Knowledge is little; to know the right context is
much; to know the right spot is everything.

—Hugo von-Hofmannsthal

C hange inﬂuences market participants of every type, from the day

trader to the long-term portfolio manager. Chapter 2 established that
we are all affected in varying degrees by the evidence—or lack of
evidence—that is revealed as time passes and our decisions are cast in
new light. The next step in developing a more holistic market understand-
ing is to explore the signiﬁcance of market participants’ timeframes and the
distribution of volume among those timeframes. You are better equipped
to assess market risks and opportunities when you understand the ways
in which various timeframes coexist and intersect and how this interac-
tion results in volume distribution that reveals the motivation of each time-
frame within the evolving market landscape.

To illustrate the importance of volume distribution, we’ll look at the
automotive and housing industries. General Motors is a “long-timeframe
producer” of automobiles, and we, the general public, are “long-timeframe
purchasers.” (When we use the term long-timeframe, we are referring to
those market participants whose actions are the result of a long-term com-
mitment.) Of course, we generally don’t buy cars directly from GM—rather,
we go to our local independent dealer, who operates in the “intermediate
timeframe” (those market participants whose motives and commitments
are shorter term in nature). Let’s examine the role volume plays when these
various timeframes interact, as the resulting analysis applies equally well
to all markets that are ﬁnancial in nature.

MARKETS IN PROFILE

GM sells a car to the dealer, and the dealer sells the car to an individ-
ual. In this perfect scenario, all participants are satisﬁed. In the real world,
however, transactions are never so simple. Let’s expand the scope, and
say GM sells 50 cars to the dealer, but only 34 of them are purchased by
consumers. The dealer’s inventory begins to build, and he is forced to offer
more aggressive discounts in order to attract sales and balance inventories.
When the dealer sees his lot overﬂowing, he reduces the orders that he
places with General Motors. If dealers all over the country are experiencing
the same slowdown in sales, GM will also experience inventory build-up.
In order to keep sales and production lines moving, GM will begin to offer
incentives to both the dealer and the individual purchaser.

It is worth noting that over the years a substantial number of well-
known researchers and economists have failed to recognize the impor-
tance of volume distribution among timeframes—as well as the relevance
of the very existence of different timeframes. For example, a respected
economist recently suggested that it is obvious that there is “a buyer for
every seller and a seller for every buyer.” While it may be obvious that ev-
ery sale comes with a corresponding purchase, what many fail to grasp is
the relevance of which timeframes are behind the buying and selling. This
powerful piece of knowledge unlocks key information about the potential
for future directional movement.

In our automotive industry example, it is true that overall volume re-
mained constant—for every seller there was, in fact, a buyer. However, the
timeframe that was holding that volume had everything to do with price
movement. Because the dealers and GM were holding the majority of in-
ventory (volume), price had to move lower to attract long-term buyers.

A review of the housing industry over the past ﬁve years also serves
to highlight the importance of timeframes and volume distribution. As in-
terest rates fell, driving mortgage rates to historic lows, more families
(long-timeframe buyers) began to purchase single-family residences. As
the real estate market began to heat up, builders like Toll Brothers Inc.
(long-timeframe sellers) built both on contract and speculation, conﬁdent
they could sell into the hot housing market. Talk in the media, among bro-
kers, and in coffee shops consistently described the real estate market as
a “seller’s market.” The combination of a poorly performing equity market,
attractive mortgage rates, and rising home prices caused investors to begin
to view real estate as an attractive investment alternative. By 2005, follow-
ing several years of consistently rising home prices, nearly 25 percent of all
individuals (intermediate-term timeframes) held second homes.

Let’s look a little closer at the different timeframe participants in
the housing market and how their actions drove the auction process.
Initially, there was a reasonably close balance between the long time-
frame buyer and seller. As the market continued to heat up, however, an

chapter03

imbalance developed between them; builders (sellers) couldn’t meet de-
mand and so price began to auction higher seeking a new balance. With
prices rising (advertising opportunity), more and more local builders en-
tered the market place, building homes both on contract and for specu-
lation. Among the last to enter the foray were the inexperienced individ-
ual investors, just as they did at the height of the tech bubble just ﬁve
years prior. Individuals with no real estate experience whatsoever were
buying second, third, and fourth homes with “no money down,” hoping
to ﬂip them three to six months later at a huge proﬁt. Essentially, a new
breed of short-term real estate “traders” was born. But ﬁnally, as in all
auctions, the imbalance of demand shifted and the housing market be-
came over supplied, which lead to inventory being held by the shortest of
timeframes.

The real estate example is similar to the GM example, even though
the industries are completely different. Our position has always been that
all markets that are ﬁnancial in nature—whether they are comprised of
stocks, bonds, commodities, futures, currencies, real estate, automobiles,
or any other goods and services—operate in a similar fashion: they all in-
volve an auction process of some form that facilitates the involvement of
participants operating under different timeframes.

The market’s auction process serves to fairly distribute bids and offers.
In Chapter 4, we explore in greater depth how the market’s auction process
also serves as an important information-discovery mechanism, traveling
(via price) up and down to uncover and accommodate the needs of both
supply and demand. By observing this auction process unfold via the Mar-
ket Proﬁle tool, we can begin to assess the attitudes and interactions of
the different timeframes. Just as in the GM and real estate examples, im-
balances in the securities markets occur among different timeframes and
the markets adjust to accommodate. However, unlike the automobile and
housing markets with their slow-moving inventories, the securities mar-
kets enable extremely fast build-up and liquidation of inventories, which
makes it extraordinarily difﬁcult to continually assess market conditions.
It is precisely for this reason that market-generated information and the
Market Proﬁle are so valuable.

BREAKING DOWN MARKET TIMEFRAMES

The concepts in this book are built on an understanding of the way the
various timeframes coexist, intersect, and interact. To establish a founda-
tion for this understanding, we must ﬁrst deﬁne the different market time-
frames, as well as the general motivations of each.

Scalper

MARKETS IN PROFILE

The scalper lives by the minute hand, continually buying and selling in or-
der to take advantage of ﬂeeting discrepancies in order ﬂow. Scalpers may
make as many as several hundred trades a day, comprising thousands of
contracts. The classic image of a scalper portrays an individual who shouts,
shoves, and survives on the exchange ﬂoors. But advances in technology
and mobile communication now enable the scalper to conduct his or her
business from virtually anywhere.

Scalpers rely on intuition. They buy from and sell to all timeframes,
and their ability to respond to the immediate needs of the marketplace
provides essential liquidity. As you may have guessed, this, the shortest
of timeframes, tends to be utterly detached from longer-term economic
thinking; fundamental information is far too slow and cumbersome. The
scalper’s world is that of bids and asks and order-ﬂow depth. I remember
when a friend and comember of the CBOT called to tell me that one of
the most successful local traders wanted to come up to my ofﬁce for a
chat. Just before we hung up, my friend said, “Don’t mess this guy up with
theory—he knows nothing about the inverse relationship between bond
prices and yield. He’s just a master of reading order ﬂow.”

Day Trader

The day trader enters the market with no position and goes home the same
way. Day traders process news announcements, reﬂect on technical analy-
sis, and read order ﬂow in order to make trading decisions. They also have
to deal with long- and short-term program buying and selling, brokerage
ﬁrm margin calls, mortgage banker’s duration adjustments, speeches by
Federal Reserve governors, and “important pronouncements” by political
leaders and inﬂuential portfolio managers. Anyone who believes markets
are rational should spend a day trying to digest and react to the landslide
of conﬂicting data day traders must wade through to make a decision.

This group focuses on large quantities of technical information; they
love numbers and levels and hype. Like scalpers, day traders also provide
liquidity for markets, although very often at great personal expense.

Short-Term Traders

Short-term traders often hold trades longer than a day, but usually not
longer than three to ﬁve days. There is no scientiﬁc evidence to support
this view, but I observed this timeframe’s behavior when I ran a discount
brokerage ﬁrm in Chicago in the late 1980s. Short-term traders, such as
day traders, have to contend with a huge quantity of data. But they tend

chapter03

Timeframes

33

to pay more attention to technical and economic fundamentals. Short-term
traders generally focus on multiple days of overlapping prices, attempting
to buy the lows and sell the highs while watching for breakouts. They use
market-momentum indicators and monitor trend lines and trading chan-
nels to time their buys and sells. They are not out to inﬂuence market be-
havior but to be ﬂexible and adaptable enough to react to and capitalize on
events that trigger short-term market movements.

Intermediate Traders/Investors

The difference between intermediate traders/investors and short-term
traders is simply that they operate from a longer point of view. Partici-
pants of this timeframe are often referred to as “swing traders” because
they look to trade the tops and bottoms of intermediate-term ranges such
as the one illustrated in Figure 3.1, which illustrates the S&P market from
November 11, 2005, through February 16, 2006. Intermediate traders bank
on the fact that markets, like pendulums, travel only so far in one direction
before changing course.

MARKETS IN PROFILE

Within the range deﬁned in Figure 3.1, consolidation areas developed
that provided shorter-term traders with fertile ﬁshing grounds. The point
here is that the intermediate timeframe relies on distance traveled, not
time, to inﬂuence trade decisions. Within consolidation areas, volatility can
become quite extreme because combinations of these shorter timeframe
investors and traders are often active at the same time—and in opposite
directions.

The intermediate timeframe uses both fundamental and technical anal-
ysis, and normally has no desire to break new ground, choosing instead
to operate within historic trading ranges. However, they do pay close at-
tention to momentum and will quickly jump on board a trend when the
longest timeframe begins to move prices beyond the containment levels
of the intermediate-term market. When this activity occurs, multiple time-
frames are acting in concert and longer-term trends often develop.

The weekly bar chart of the S&P 500 in Figure 3.2 shows several
intermediate-term trading ranges. Notice that the market tends to spend
much more time in overlapping ranges (brackets) than it does trending.
This is typical. Notice also that there are several smaller trading ranges
within the intermediate-term brackets, and that these brackets (at least

ranges within well-deﬁned, intermediate-term brackets are the focus of the
shorter-term traders we discussed earlier. In the last several chapters of
this book, we offer tactical trading guidance for day traders, short-term
traders, intermediate-term traders, and longer-term investors.

Figure 3.3 shows: (1) a day-timeframe auction; (2) a nine-day, shorter-
term auction; and (3) and (4) the start and end of a swing trade occurring
in the U.S. Treasury bond market. With the exception of the day timeframe,
it is important to understand that the remaining classiﬁcations are deﬁned
in general terms and vary depending on both market activity and how each
individual trader/investor visualizes the market. For example, while some
investors see long-term trades in terms of years, others in the money man-
agement industry consider “long term” to be a much shorter duration.

Long-Term Investors

Long-term investors are far more attached to the securities they own. They
have a stronger tendency to buy securities and put them away for some

time, with holding periods from months up to several years. When they are
active, they tend to deal in large positions that are very visible to the mar-
ket. Intuitive shorter timeframe participants understand that when the long
timeframe enters the market, their purchases are likely to be large and pos-
sibly ongoing. With the size of money management ﬁrms these days, indi-
vidual trades—even partial trades—can result in huge orders. In fact, some
shorter-timeframe traders research what the long-term investors already
hold, so that when they sense them selling they can take advantage of the
resulting price movement. When the longest timeframe becomes active, it
is not uncommon for all other timeframes to join in a large movement that
can result in a major trend. Figure 3.4 shows just such a movement occur-
ring in the S&P 500 during the latter half of 2003. Those traders who fail to
grasp transitions of that magnitude will not survive.

When we take an even longer-term perspective, we can more clearly
see how the various timeframes coexist, act in concert, and merge over
time. Figure 3.5 shows:

1. All timeframes are acting in unison, resulting in a longer-term upward

trend.

2. The longer-term trend tops out (temporarily) when the market begins
a series of intermediate timeframe auctions as it balances and seeks
equilibrium. Here, longer timeframe buyers provide support to the mar-
ket, while the day, shorter-term, and intermediate timeframes facilitate
the auction process from both sides of the market. As a result of this
auction process, long-term value is established at higher price levels.
3. After the period of balance, the longer-timeframe buyer auctions price

above the balance area and the longer-term trend continues.

Long-term investors, as we’re deﬁning them here, are responsible for
breaking new ground, starting trends, upsetting the status quo. While this
investor timeframe doesn’t necessarily account for a large portion of mar-
ket volume, it is generally responsible for large directional moves in the
market. Why? Because the shorter timeframes primarily exist to facilitate
liquidity, while the long-term investor is placing substantial orders in one
direction. In other words, long-term money is much “stickier.”

Long-term investors tend to look at the fundamentals of a company,
the quality of their earnings, cash ﬂow to book value, P/E multiples, talent,

new ideas, pricing power, industry strength, and so on. They might not even
consider the technical information that drives many shorter timeframe de-
cisions.

What is important about the preceding discussion is the idea that mar-
ket activity is inﬂuenced by a wide variety of participants operating under
a wide variety of timeframes and motivations. The way each of these par-
ticipants combines and employs information is different:

Ĺ Scalpers are aware of key market reference points, but rely primarily

on intuition and order ﬂow.

Ĺ Day traders depend almost exclusively on market-generated informa-
tion, because fundamental information is usually too cumbersome and
can actually be counterintuitive for the process of day trading.

Ĺ Short-term traders supplement market-generated information with an
awareness of recent fundamental information and the effects it can
have on market movement.

Ĺ Intermediate-term traders rely on a balanced mix of fundamental and

market-generated information.

Ĺ Long-term investors tend to follow fundamental information ﬁrst, fol-
lowed by market valuation, ﬁnally looking to market-generated infor-
mation to supplement their understanding of market activity and indi-
vidual securities. They also keep an eye out for trims and adds, and
inﬂow and outﬂow of funds requirement.

It’s not easy to comprehend the nature and interaction of the different
timeframes. And it’s extremely challenging to detect their everchanging in-
ﬂuence to implement a successful trading strategy. That’s why it’s essen-
tial that you understand the fundamental nature of each timeframe before
we build on that knowledge with new concepts—concepts that may ini-
tially appear contradictory. We structured Mind over Markets around the
ﬁve steps of learning (the path from novice to expert), and it is worth not-
ing here that in order to take your market insight to the next level, you’ll
have to unlearn some of the rules that got you where you were before. But
once you have jettisoned concepts that may be limiting the breadth of your
knowledge, you’ll be better able to comprehend and integrate the myriad
relevant pieces necessary to understanding the broader paradigm of mar-
ket activity.

In real-time trading and investing, the timeframes are far more difﬁ-
cult to distinguish than the neat descriptions above might suggest. While
we have identiﬁed them separately, all timeframes coexist, intersect, and
interact with one another in a constantly shifting tapestry. It is the study of
this coexistence, intersection, and interaction that will comprise your real

learning. And, in one way or another, it is largely the topic of the balance
of this book.

As you continue to observe market activity, you will begin to recognize
combinations of timeframe patterns over time. Trading requires a great
deal of mental ﬂexibility, because once you have learned to recognize a cer-
tain pattern, it may soon be supplanted by another, more-relevant pattern,
which itself will eventually perish. The point being that traders who inte-
grate discipline, emotional control, and an agile market understanding are
generally able to let go of prior patterns and habits that are no longer work-
ing. To be successful, investors must recognize the conﬂuence of evolving
factors that will eventually lead to a changing market atmosphere.

YOUR TIMEFRAME IS YOUR STRATEGY
CORNERSTONE

If you can correctly identify which timeframe is in control of market activ-
ity, and you have a good understanding of how the individual timeframes
generally behave, then you are in a stronger position to trade, invest, and
effectively control risk.

Throughout the course of this book, you will not only learn how to
identify which timeframes are active and in control at any given moment,
but you will also begin to learn to identify your own timeframe; that is, the
timeframe that suits your investment personality best. This is vital, for if
you don’t have an accurate idea of your timeframe and how it behaves in
the context of all other timeframes, you are setting yourself up to be con-
fused and misled by conﬂicting information. For example, it’s easy to be
right in the short term but wrong in the long term—a position which can be
extraordinarily costly. Once you have clearly deﬁned your timeframe—and
how it coexists, intersects, and interacts with the others—you will be more
conﬁdent and better disciplined, and therefore less likely to break strategy
when the market acts contrary to your expectations. You’ll also be more
cognizant of the larger context, which will enable you to improve your
trade location—and good trade location is the key to managing risk, in ev-
ery timeframe.

Auctions and

Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has
seen and thinking what nobody has thought.

—Albert von Szent-Gyorgyi

I n this chapter, we’ll discuss how the factors that inﬂuence market

activity—information and the different timeframes that process and
react to that information—can be observed in a context that promotes
transparency. We use the term “transparency” here because it means
“readily understandable” while also relating to the clarity of your decision-
making process. Even when something is utterly clear, if we lose sight of
the larger context, we are liable to make signiﬁcant errors in judgment.

The Market Proﬁle assembles the building blocks of market activity
(time, price, and volume) by organizing the auction process into a coherent
visual framework. A market proﬁle is an entirely objective organizational
tool that incorporates all information in a context that is free of bias, free
from the conﬂicting indicators generated by an overwhelming number of
facts, each inﬂuenced and surrounded by a diverse set of circumstances.
In short, a market proﬁle provides “transparent” information. That is, in-
formation that is available to all market participants on an unrestricted
basis; information that is easily understood and available in a single coher-
ent mechanism; and information that manifests ongoing market activity in
the form of recognizable shapes and patterns.

Let’s now assemble the speciﬁc elements of market-generated informa-
tion so that our decision-making process becomes transparent—and you
can start to develop an understanding of what key structural patterns may
indicate with respect to future market activity.

Historically, price has been the main piece of information that has pro-
moted transparency. The Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at
the University of Chicago provides years of price data for indexes, stocks,
bonds, and mutual funds. Unfortunately, price without context is just a
number—for all intents and purposes a random event. A sequence of prices
can be entirely misleading as it leaves vital questions unanswered: Did a
particular price occur on higher or lower volume? Was a price sequence
the result of new business or old business (short covering and long liquida-
tion are considered old business, as they don’t contribute to net new long
or short positions)? Which timeframe was primarily responsible for that
price? Which direction was the market attempting to travel at the time the
price occurred? As you will see, a market proﬁle provides answers to these
all-important questions by giving dimension to price—dimension that is
necessary to achieve complete transparency.

In Chapter 2, we identiﬁed the three fundamental elements that com-
prise the market’s auctions—time, price, and volume. We stated that price
is simply the auction’s means of advertising opportunity, with time regulat-
ing each opportunity, and volume measuring the success or failure of each
auction.

These three auction elements can also be viewed as follows:

Ĺ Price is a volatile variable and the fastest moving market element.
Ĺ Time is the constant around which all auction data is organized.
Ĺ Volume is also a variable, but it changes much more gradually than

price (and volume represents the interaction of time and price).

THE SEARCH FOR VALUE

To better understand how price, time, and volume create market-generated
information, imagine that you’re attending an art auction. Before the ﬁrst
item is introduced, you sit in the audience and ponder a question that has
been nagging you, recently: How does auction movement reveal the moti-
vations of the market’s participants?

The lights dim, a spotlight reveals a lovely oil painting center stage,
and the auctioneer begins his rhythmic pitter-patter banter. The excitement
in the room is palpable. “We start the bidding for this remarkable landscape
at nine hundred,” he says, “nine hundred . . . nine hundred? Do I have nine
hundred for this beautiful work?”

You stare at the painting and think it might make a nice addition to
your living room. No one has yet bid, and so the auctioneer lowers the
price, looking for that ﬁrst paddle to rise: “Now eight ﬁfty . . . eight ﬁfty? Do

chapter04

Auctions and Indicators

43

I have eight ﬁfty for this unique oil painting—I have eight ﬁfty. Do I have
nine? . . . .”

Because no one responded to the initial price, the auctioneer quickly
lowered the bid until he found a level at which participants began to re-
spond. Now that the ice is broken and the auction is underway, the bid
quickly exceeds the initial, unaccepted $900 bid: “I’m bid nine hundred. . .
now nine and a quarter nine and a quarter. I’m bid nine and a quarter . . .
now nine ﬁfty, nine ﬁfty, I’m bid nine seventy-ﬁve.”

The bid races to a thousand dollars, and you feel your adrenaline surge,
as you really like the painting. You lift your paddle and the auctioneer nods
and his patter speeds on, the price ratcheting rapidly higher as he creates
excitement with the intensity of his voice. Once bidding gets underway,
it’s quite common to have bidding begin to build. Just like in the ﬁnancial
markets, very few individuals want to accept the risk of being ﬁrst and
being wrong, which might be seen as foolish by peers.

The price of the painting climbs past $1,500, and you decide the green
of the ﬁelds might actually clash with your living-room rug. The auction-
eer’s rapid-ﬁre delivery continues unabated, sustaining the excitement in
the room. But being a careful listener, you note that he is beginning to add
quite a lot of “ﬁller” to his patter to make it appear that the auction is still
proceeding higher. This process continues until the last bidder bids, and
the rant is capped with a hearty: “SOLD at eighteen seventy-ﬁve!” You’re
glad you didn’t get caught up in the hype, and you turn your attention to
the next piece being unveiled on stage.

In the preceding example, there was only one item to be auctioned.
If this were the everﬂowing process of a ﬁnancial market, however, the
auction would have begun again in the opposite direction once the upward
auction had discovered the last bidder. From the price at which the auction
ﬁnally got under way—$850—there was only a brief price/time relation-
ship because price moved quickly. As price began to climb steadily higher,
“value” was established as multiple bidders actively engaged in the auction
at prices they believed to be fair. At the level where the price advance be-
gan to slow, and the auctioneer began to pad his banter in order to make
it seem as if the auction were still healthy, an extended price/time relation-
ship developed; bidders in the top quadrant of the price range were most
probably engaged in an overreaction to the momentum of the auction, ﬁ-
nally purchasing above the value area.

The value area, as we explained in Chapter 2, represents the range
in which approximately 70 percent of the volume of activity took place
(one standard deviation of the resulting bell curve’s distribution). In the art
auction, there was a lone bidder at the bottom and a lone buyer at the top,
and of course the highest number of bidders in the middle; volume was high
in this range because the auction process revealed an area of “fair value”

for the painting on the block. In a ﬁnancial market, the value area at the end
of the day represents the range within which most market participants that
had day-timeframe business to conduct were willing to enact that business.
A review of Figure 4.1 reveals the value area in the center of the market
proﬁle. The top end of the proﬁle was where price auctioned too high and
buying dried up, and the bottom of the proﬁle was where price auctioned
too low, cutting off selling activity.

Our art auction example, of course, doesn’t represent the complexity
of the auction process in ﬁnancial markets. Daily markets are comprised
of several continuous two-way auctions that establish a range for the day,
including a high, low, and value area. These indicators do not occur in any
particular order—the high for the day can be established at the opening
bell, right at close, or anywhere in between—and are not fully deﬁned until
the day’s trading is concluded and the market proﬁle is complete. How-
ever, with enough training, concentration, and practice, you will be able to
visualize which proﬁle patterns are most likely to develop, long before the
market close.

As we begin to delve deeper into the conﬂuence of various market
variables, it is important to emphasize the value of a receptive mind; pat-
tern recognition is only valuable if you can avoid wishful thinking and
continually seek to understand market activity in the present tense. The
patterns we are about to discuss are not set in stone. It is hoped, how-
ever, that they will serve to prepare you to recognize change ahead of your
competition—and before opportunity is lost.

If you compare any given day in a market to the previous day, you
will observe that some degree of change has occurred. This change may
be very slight—almost insigniﬁcant, when a market is in balance. Or the
change may be pronounced when the market is trending, breaking out of
balance, or in the midst of a short-covering rally, liquidating break, or other
unusual occurrence.

Each day will also, to some degree, create a divergence between price
as it relates to value. As price attempts to move away from value, there are
both expected and unexpected responses. As price auctions higher, it is
expected that demand will dwindle and prices eventually trade back down
toward the daily mean. As the prices move lower, supply usually diminishes
and prices auction back up toward the daily mean, or value area.

Returning to our art auction example, we can demonstrate another
phenomenon. Once the auction is underway, the price quickly surpassed
the failed early attempt to open at $900 and then proceeded upward until
the auction slowed and the ﬁnal bid was eventually cast. In some cases,
however, higher prices, instead of diminishing demand, have the opposite
effect. If this had been the case, the auctioneer would not have needed
ﬁller to maintain a feeling of potential and excitement; you would have
heard him say (with some enthusiasm): “New bidder!” Higher prices could
have served to attract increased demand, rather than shutting it off. This
kind of activity tells us that the auction is far from complete. As we have
said, all markets that are ﬁnancial in nature operate in a similar manner,
and this same phenomenon occurs in listed markets, as demonstrated in
Figure 4.2.

In Figure 4.2, price continued to auction higher throughout the day,
with occasional pauses that served to communicate to new buyers that
value was being accepted higher.

Concept Review

Before we proceed, let’s review the salient concepts we’ve covered thus far
in Markets in Proﬁle:

1. Structure, as revealed by the Market Proﬁle, is developed through
a two-way auction process, and every day the auctions result

in a range, value area, high,
low, and comparative amount of
change when measured against previous days (and weeks, months,
etc.).

2. By reviewing the resulting proﬁle, we are able to observe the differ-
ence between price and value, so we can begin to assess whether price
might return to value (see Figure 4.1) or might lead to value higher (see
Figure 4.2).

3. The auctions, on most days, enable us to quickly see which prices
strayed too far from value and were not accompanied by increased vol-
ume, resulting in a regression back toward the mean. In Figure 4.2, we
saw just the opposite—the auction explored lower prices early in the
morning and established an overreaction low, which, after the auction
got started, was never challenged again that day. The upward auction
continued to attract new bidders each time prices explored upper price
levels, as witnessed by higher volume (acceptance of value).

4. A market proﬁle enables us to see structure as it develops in real time.
With receptivity, concentration, and practice, you can begin to visual-
ize the ﬁnal market structure prior to its completion. We will spend
time more fully developing this theme in later chapters.

The practical side of what we have seen so far is as follows:
Figure 4.1. The market is in balance in the day timeframe. If you are
looking to buy and the auction explores downward with the expected
response—lower prices slow down supply—then you buy at those lower
prices and so acquire your merchandise below perceived value. Market-
generated information reveals that this is your opportunity. If you wait
for price to return to value, you can still make your purchase at a “fair
price” for the day (within the value area). However, buying as price ex-
plores the upper price levels—on a day in which the market is balanced
in the day timeframe—means that you have acquired your merchandise at
prices above value. And as a result, the odds are not in your favor that price
will be able to raise value.

Figure 4.2. Again, if you are looking to buy and enter the market during
the early downward exploration, you would have successfully purchased
your merchandise below value. Waiting for a return to value will, as in the
last example, still allow you to purchase merchandise at fair value. Any
purchase above the value area (on this day) still allows you to purchase at
value or below, because price is leading value higher. If, however, you had
merchandise to sell on this day and you sold at any time, the best you could
have hoped for was to sell at value; more than likely you sold at prices
below value. Of course proﬁts occur when you purchase below value and

chapter04

MARKETS IN PROFILE

sell at or above value, but proﬁts also occur when you buy at value and sell
above value.

You should realize by now that not all prices are equal, nor are all op-
portunities. Buying below value in either of the examples above provided
an asymmetric proﬁt opportunity in which opportunity exceeded risk.
Selling below value, in either example, also resulted in an asymmetric situ-
ation in which risk exceeded potential reward.

The key, of course, is recognizing these developing patterns before
they’re complete. Learning how to extract structural clues early in the
day, or early on during an intermediate- or longer-timeframe auction, is
what this book is ultimately about. Now, let’s continue to explore the ways
in which market-generated information enables transparency around the
market’s everchanging motives.

KEY MARKET-GENERATED INDICATORS

In Chapter 1, we said we would show you how to use market-generated
information to identify and adapt to change before your competitors. Let’s
now turn our attention to several key reference points that make it possible
to measure degrees of change. We have established the fact that the devel-
oping value area helps us observe the changing relationship between price
and value in the day timeframe. Taking a slightly longer viewpoint, value-
area comparison can reveal important clues about the movement of value
across days and weeks. By comparing daily value areas and price ranges,
the market’s proclivity to change becomes somewhat transparent.

Each day’s initial balance is also part of the larger contextual under-
standing that we seek. Nothing more than the range a given security traded
within during the ﬁrst two trading periods, the initial balance represents
the market’s open and initial auction explorations and can reveal vital clues
as to where the day’s activity is likely to occur.

Range extension occurs when new auctions lengthen the market pro-
ﬁle shape beyond the range established during the initial balance men-
tioned above. Range extension is an indicator that allows us to gauge
buyer/seller strength. If price auctions above the initial balance and results
in new buying activity, it becomes clear that there is real buying strength;
and when price auctions lower and gains acceptance, then it is apparent
that selling strength is materializing. Range extension elongates the proﬁle,
allowing us to visualize the aggressiveness of buyers or sellers. Returning
to our art auctioneer, if price extends upward and higher prices continue
to attract additional buying, then the auctioneer would constantly be an-
nouncing “new bids!”

Figure 4.3 shows the initial balance—B and C periods—followed by
selling range extension beginning in G period and continuing downward
through the end of the day.

Let’s begin to synthesize these key indicators. If there is a lack of range
extension, limited range extension, or range extension in both directions
with price returning to the value area, then the structural evidence suggests
that the market is balanced—for the time being, at least. In Figure 4.4, price
explored above the initial balance (B and C periods) in G and H periods,
but new buying did not occur and price returned to the center of the market
proﬁle, which reafﬁrms that the market was indeed balanced.

Now let’s further widen our understanding of market-generated indi-
cators by examining a day’s value-area placement in relationship to the

previous day’s value area. Figure 4.5 graphically displays some of these
possible relationships.

Starting with the relationship in the upper left of Figure 4.5, you can
see that the new day’s value area has developed clearly higher than the
previous day’s value area. We are far more interested in value than price
because value is far more stable and indicative of real market momentum.
For example, there are frequently occasions in which price is higher, while
value is actually unchanged—or even lower. In the second example, in the
upper center, the value area has migrated lower. The following two exam-
ples portray overlapping relationships, and the ﬁnal two exhibit days in
which value develops either outside of the previous day’s value or, in the
last example, totally within the prior value area.

In Chapter 5, we begin to create a coherent whole out of all the analytic
indicators introduced here; however, before we begin that process, you
must ﬁrst understand the signiﬁcance of volume transparency, attempted
direction, and symmetry.

When we ﬁrst began to employ the Market Proﬁle in the 1980s, we
could be exacting with the horizontal axis, which represents time, and the
vertical axis, which represents price, but volume had to be estimated by
employing the following formula: Price × Times = Volume. This proved to
be fairly accurate when compared to the daily volume breakdown at each
price level reported after the close. Only a limited number of exchanges
such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of
Trade, which fostered the development of the Market Proﬁle, reported
volume in this manner. Today, an increasing number of exchanges, both
in the United States and overseas, have endorsed electronic trading,
which captures volume instantly, greatly increasing transparency for all
market participants. With electronic trading, time, price, and volume can
be graphed in real-time via Market Proﬁle. Where electronic trading and
instant volume reporting is available, transparency is complete, and the

playing ﬁeld is level; all market participants have access to the same timely
information on actual order ﬂow.

Rising price on increasing volume reveals the fact that value is rising
(“I’m bid nine hundred, now nine and a quarter. I’m bid nine and a quar-
ter . . . now nine ﬁfty. I’m bid nine seventy-ﬁve.”) The same scenario on
decreasing volume would be neutral at best, indicating that the auction
is losing momentum (“Do I hear nine ﬁfty for this superlative example of
ﬁfteenth century landscape?”). As markets conduct their business through
continuous two-way auctions, declining price on increasing volume is bear-
ish, and decreasing volume is either neutral or bullish.

The ﬁnal analysis of any given auction or trading day is highly depen-
dent upon the variance-from-mean volume. Remember, the principles we
have discussed are applicable for all timeframes. This can be extremely
confusing until you learn to identify which timeframes are active. For
example, if the markets are demonstrating intermediate-term balance, as
well as short-term balance, volume is likely to be of lesser importance to
the long-term trader. However, should the market approach or break out
of either of the extremes of the intermediate-term range, the long-term in-
vestor/trader would deﬁnitely be concerned with volume.

Most serious traders and investors are familiar with the term “re-
gression to mean.” This simple concept is at the core of the current
discussion—attempted breakouts that result in decreasing volume are
likely to see price revert back toward the mean. Attempted breakouts that
result in increasing volume, however, reveal that new, aggressive partici-
pants have entered the market. In these circumstances, new value areas
are likely to be established for all timeframes.

We have continually stressed the importance of context. The following
examination of attempted direction is no exception. The ﬁrst step in prop-
erly assessing the relevance of volume is to determine which direction the
market was attempting to auction when that volume was established—an
assessment that can often be difﬁcult. If the attempted direction cannot be
determined, then it is not wise to make a volume assessment; the market
was probably balanced, and the auctions rotated relatively equally between
high and low. In Figure 4.6, for example, the market opened near the high of
the daily range, traded lower, rotating several times above and below the
midpoint, and ﬁnally ﬁnished near the highs for the day. In this instance,
we don’t see any clear signs of attempted direction. For those trading very
short timeframes, such as 5- and 10-minute bars, there may have been
clearly deﬁned attempted direction. As your timeframe lengthens, how-
ever, determining attempted direction on this day became non-productive.
In Figure 4.7 (see page 54), it’s relatively easy to observe that the day’s
attempted direction was up as the market opened near the low and closed
near the high. But let’s consider a more complex example, one in which

a stock rallies to new highs, breaking 100 for the ﬁrst time. Experts go on
record saying they’ll buy the stock on a correction. Most investors assume
that a “correction” in this context would mean a decline in prices after the
stock’s rally. While such a dip could occur, the “correction” does not neces-
sarily have to result in lower prices—new long-term buyers could enter the
market, buying from short-term sellers and keeping the price from falling.
This activity effectively relieves holders of old long positions of their mer-
chandise, replacing them with new long-term buyers.

Without a ﬂexible, well-prepared mind, this latter form of correction
could take place without your ever having realized it. In fact, the market
could exhibit clearly higher price and value—but with attempted direction

Without considering the larger context, price alone could confuse you, so
that you completely miss the next bullish move upward. Of course, the
same thing can just as easily happen on the downside.

Attempted direction is an important element in compiling a holistic
opinion using market-generated information. Like any task that requires

skill, however, it takes time and dedicated practice in order to learn to
make the correct assessment of attempted direction on any given day.

The ﬁnal market indicator we’ll address in this chapter is symmetry.
The market proﬁle is not, as you have already surmised, always symmetri-
cal, and that lack of symmetry can have very speciﬁc consequences. In his
book The Mature Mind (New York: Basic Books, 2005), Gene D. Cohen,
M.D., Ph.D., discusses the ways in which younger people tend to place
more emphasis on the left hemisphere of the brain—that hemisphere that
perceives the world analytically—in making decisions, while more mature
(older) people tend to merge information from both hemispheres in their
decision making. Not surprisingly, Cohen surmises that whole-brained de-
cisions are better decisions. Words and numbers are the language of the
left hemisphere, while the right hemisphere is more capable of capturing
the world synthetically, parsing the meaning and import of images, models,
and feelings.

The market proﬁle captures the market’s fundamental building blocks
(price, time, and volume) in a visual graphic that enables us to see the
market’s structure. This allows us to evaluate market activity by us-
ing both of our information-processing modes—the analytic left hemi-
sphere in conjunction with the synthetic right hemisphere. According to
Dr. Cohen (and everybody else), this should result in better decision
making.

The proﬁle graphic captures and displays a great deal of data in a sim-
pliﬁed form, which enables us to better understand the complex relation-
ships that exist between the multiple economic indicators and timeframes
we have discussed. A market proﬁle that is symmetrical, within its time-
frame, offers symmetric risk/reward opportunities on both the long and
short side of the market. Such a market in balance represents a situation
that is as close to the efﬁcient market theory as is possible. A symmetrical
market is waiting for new information before it makes its next directional
move.

Nonsymmetrical proﬁles identify markets that are imbalanced. In such
out-of-balance situations, the market proﬁle helps identify advantageous
investment opportunities, as well as situations that would yield poor odds.
Nonsymmetrical markets occur under several conditions. The ﬁrst devel-
ops when the market is trending, and multiple timeframes are acting in
concert; the resulting series of proﬁles will be elongated in the direction
of the move. The second is a nonsymmetrical proﬁle with a weighted up-
per end, which occurs when only limited timeframes are buying the mar-
ket. A pronounced example of this phenomenon, shown in Figure 4.8, gen-
erally signiﬁes short covering that is not accompanied by new long-term
buying.

Similarly, a nonsymmetrical proﬁle shape that is weighted to the down-
side represents selling by limited timeframes. Figure 4.9 demonstrates this
condition.

PERFECTING THE ART OF VISUALIZATION

The Market Proﬁle is a simple tool that builds a graphic out of the mar-
ket’s continuous auction process. As that graphic reveals itself over the
course of any given day, there are key market-generated indicators that
can reveal what the market is inclined to do—indicators like value area,
initial balance, range extension, attempted direction, and symmetry. Any
one of these indicators, when taken out of context, can lead you down a
blind alley; all market activity must be observed in the light of larger mar-
ket context. In the following chapters, you will begin to learn how to use
the indicators highlighted here to make more effective trading decisions.

As in any endeavor that involves complex associations, an actionable
understanding of the market’s developing auction process can only be per-
fected through extensive observation and study. The world’s top chess
players are not merely “intuitive,” but have spent considerable time pour-
ing over patterns and potentialities, searching for that elusive advantage
over the competition.

Not everything that counts can be counted, and not

—Sign hanging in Albert Einstein’s
Princeton University ofﬁce

C hapter 4 focused on isolating key indicators revealed by the auction

process. The art auction we described was extremely simpliﬁed—a
one-time event geared only to facilitate the sale of a single item.
In the ﬁnancial markets, this process is continual, with multiple time-
frames inﬂuencing market behavior and multiple items continually being
bought and sold. As a result, the indicators we deﬁned never occur in
isolation—they must always be considered within the complex, everchang-
ing context of which they are a part.

To use an everyday analogy, consider the act of picking up a cup of
coffee. On the surface, this process may seem so simple it needs no expla-
nation. But the brain must ﬁrst interpret the reﬂection of light off the cup’s
surface, and then send dozens of impulses to a variety of muscle groups
that must work in perfect synchrony. Now think about the astounding num-
ber of simultaneous processes that must coincide ﬂawlessly to enable a
baseball player to hit a fastball moving at 90 miles per hour.

The same is true with trading: the process is complex. Markets are
continuously inﬂuenced by news, multiple timeframe participants, buying
and selling driven by wildly varying objectives, short covering, liquidating
breaks, and on and on. When information compounds upon other infor-
mation, it gets exponentially more difﬁcult to sort out the “net effect” of
the current auction and to keep the activity of the different timeframes

straight. As we have said before, it takes an incredible amount of practice
to become an expert trader, one who is capable of observing, understand-
ing, and deciphering—in the present tense—the ﬂux of constantly evolving
market indicators.

AUCTIONS IN ACTION

Now, let’s attempt to integrate many of the concepts that we’ve discussed
thus far by reviewing Treasury refunding, a relatively short-timeframe
auction. Currently, the Treasury sells bills in 3- and 6-month month ma-
turities; notes in 2-, 5-, and 10-year maturities; 30-year bonds; and Trea-
sury inﬂation-indexed securities. The auction process begins with a public
announcement by the U.S. Treasury that includes which security is to be
auctioned, the amount of the issuance, maturity of the security, and the
amount of cash to be raised, a portion of which will re-fund maturing debt
with the remainder funding new debt.

Bids are accepted up to 30 days prior to the auction; however, the
primary dealers—the ﬁnancial institutions that have been recognized by
the New York Fed—purchase most of the inventory, generally submitting
bids at the last possible moment, often just moments before the auction
deadline. There are two kinds of bids that can be submitted: competitive
bids, normally submitted by primary dealers, and noncompetitive tenders,
which are generally submitted by small investors and individuals. The pri-
mary dealers submit bids for both themselves and their customers, and
most of the securities they purchase will later be resold—to other deal-
ers, companies, banks, individuals, and the like. The ﬁxed-income mar-
ket often “backs up,” or “sells off,” prior to the Treasury auctions as the
dealers attempt to create a spread, so that the securities they buy can
be resold at a proﬁt. In this sense, they’re similar to the automobile deal-
ers and home builders that we discussed in Chapter 3; the government is
the long-timeframe issuer of the securities, and individuals, pension funds,
endowments, and foundations are among the long-term holders. If every-
one guesses correctly, the newly issued securities pass from the Treasury
through the dealers that make their markups and into the hands of other
ﬁnancial institutions that either hold them for their own accounts or resell
the securities to long-term, “sticky-money” investors.

Just as we discussed in the automotive example, it doesn’t always hap-
pen this way. Sometimes the dealers get stuck with inventory that isn’t im-
mediately distributed to long-timeframe investors. To balance their inven-
tories, the remaining securities must be priced (auctioned) lower, which
increases their yield and makes them more attractive to long-term buyers.
The auction continues lower until balance is restored in the market.

Long-Term Auctions

Of course, the auction can also be extremely successful when there are
more bidders than securities to go around. When this happens, it’s not un-
common to see a strong upward auction begin immediately when bidders
realize that they’re not going to get their hands on the securities that they
had hoped to acquire. These bidders may have been short, needing to buy
in order to cover, or they might have simply been trying to meet their own
quotas or the demands of their clients.

The point of this discussion is that auctions are everywhere—the auc-
tion process is the cornerstone of all business transactions. By being a con-
sumer in a market society, you have an intuitive understanding of how this
process works. Every time you go to the store you encounter auctions in
action. When you decide to pay a higher price for a gourmet frozen pizza,
the auction might not be immediately interactive (unless you have to ﬁght
through a crowd to get to the freezer), but the long-term effect is the same:
if the pizzas ﬂy off the shelf, then prices rise. Conversely, too many piz-
zas left on the shelf results in prices “auctioning” lower in order to bal-
ance inventory. This fundamental understanding—so simple it’s taken for
granted—will serve as a foundation for developing a more holistic under-
standing of the ﬁnancial markets’ compound-auction process.

THE COMPOUND-AUCTION PROCESS

results from the auction
Market-generated information—data that
process—is real-time and constantly evolving. The underlying message
here is that investment ideas based on past ﬁndings can often block new
insights, which can lead you to favor preconceptions over fresh observa-
tions. As a result, you can easily set yourself up to make ﬂawed invest-
ment/trading decisions. Combine that tendency with the natural human
inclination to focus on solutions rather than the process that leads to solu-
tions; and you’ll be incapable of understanding the true nature of real-time
market activity. In the investment-management business, the tendency by
many investment professionals to study only surface indicators has cost
legions of investors untold fortunes; if the process is ﬂawed, then you can
bet the solution will be ﬂawed as well. If your goal is to be a top-quartile
competitor, then you must immerse yourself deeply in the process—the
market’s compound-auction process.

The art auction we referenced was a useful paradigm to identify and
discuss a few individual market indicators, but the same process occurs,
with greater complexity and virtually simultaneously, when there are many
multiples of an item to be auctioned. For example, once a new auction
gets underway, multiple participants bid for supply. At lower prices, only

chapter05

MARKETS IN PROFILE

a few bids may be ﬁlled—the auction rises quickly if prices are perceived
as unfair (below value) for sellers of a certain timeframe. As price auctions
higher, more bids are accepted and some bidders drop out as prices ex-
ceed their idea of fair value. From there on, only those that must buy to
meet demand, or those caught up in the auction frenzy, continue to pur-
chase inventory as price climbs higher. Once market participants sense
that prices, for their timeframe, have auctioned above value, and that de-
mand is waning, then offers begin to exceed bids and an auction begins
in the opposite direction. Hence, the compound-auction process is an on-
going, multidirectional progression that draws in participants of different
timeframes, depending on the direction and signiﬁcance of each interstitial
price movement.

Traders and investors who operate on an intraday basis—which in-
cludes short timeframes that can range from minutes to hours—may expe-
rience several such rotational auctions in a single day. Shorter-term traders
may see their trades last for several days or weeks; intermediate-term par-
ticipants may ﬁnd that auctions relevant to their timeframe last months;
and long-term auctions can last months or years. Recognizing where you
are in the auction process determines your risk/reward relationship. You
can begin to understand where you are in the current auction process by
inspecting bar charts, which enables you to essentially “speed read” the
auctions, starting with the longest-term auctions and working toward the
daily auctions, where trade location is ultimately secured.

THE EBB AND FLOW OF BALANCE

Through studied observation, you will notice that long-term auctions don’t
go from bull to bear, or bear to bull. Rather, long-term trends ﬁrst transition
to balancing ranges before either continuing in the original direction or
beginning a new long-term auction in the opposite direction. To illustrate
this principle, observe Figure 5.1, which displays the S&P 500 market for
the period October 1998 through May 2006. (The time period and market
are irrelevant, so long as the period is sufﬁciently long to include a longer-
term auction.)

In this case, the S&P 500 trended upward until March 2000 and then
balanced through September of that same year. In October 2000, after bal-
ancing for seven months, the S&P began a sustained, long-term downward
auction that bottomed out and began to balance in October 2002. In May
2003, the market exited this balance area and began a new long-term up-
ward trend that remains intact as this is being written (May 2006). If you
look at the two periods marked “Balancing,” you will observe that the

market began the balancing process several months prior to the comple-
tion of the absolute highs and lows for the respective long-term trends.
Often, it is not until the balancing process is already underway that you
realize the long-term auction is ending and the market is coming into equi-
librium.

As you gain experience studying auctions, you will begin to recognize
the beginning of this balancing, or bracketing, process. The two balanc-
ing periods noted in Figure 5.1 are examples of intermediate-term auctions
(which we’ll cover in more depth in the next chapter). Long-term auctions
are comprised of several such intermediate-term auctions, and provide im-
portant context without which trade decisions can get lost in day-to-day
information overload.

Figure 5.2 looks more closely at the S&P 500 activity shown in
Figure 5.1 by focusing on (1) the start of the balancing process in July 2002,
which marked the end of the downward trend that began in March 2000; (2)
the upside breakout from the balancing period in May 2003; and (3) two en-
suing intermediate-term auctions that are incorporated in the longer-term
upward trend that continues as this book is being written.

WHERE DO TRENDS END AND

(Authors’ Note: The following sections are written in the ﬁrst person to
better convey the personal experience of James Dalton.)

The question I’m frequently asked is, “Why did you pick a certain pe-
riod to designate the beginning or end of a trend or balance area?” I confess
that it isn’t a science. But after looking at a wide variety of markets over
many years, the signs of transition begin to intuitively make sense. For ex-
ample, Figure 5.2 reveals two distinct lows for the S&P 500, the ﬁrst at

9,290 and the second a little over three years later at 9,390. May 2003 was
chosen as the “upside breakout” because the market had given up probing
below these signiﬁcant reference points. Following the upside breakout,
the market again balanced—or “bracketed”—for 11 months before contin-
uing onward.

Brackets arise out of the market’s innate need to balance. When price is
perceived to be away from value, the market auctions in one direction until
a new value level is found. This happens within the day, day-to-day, week-
to-week, and longer timeframes. As observers, we only know that a new
value level has been found when two-sided trade begins to take place; the
market begins to auction in both directions with relatively equal strength,
always pulled back to a central value, known in statistical circles as “the
mean.” The tighter the extremes of the bracket, the closer the perceptions
of value between buyers and sellers of all timeframes. The farther apart,
the more differing opinions are in play.

Another way to illustrate this concept is to think of a trend as a market
that is “unfair” to one side. For example, in an upward trend, the market
is telling us that prices are too low—unfair for the seller. In a bracketing
period, the market is expressing its belief that prices are once again fair
for both the long-term seller as well as the long-term buyer. The resulting
activity is a relatively well-deﬁned area of price containment, often charac-
terized by overlapping value areas. As long as the bracket holds, and par-
ticipants are in agreement regarding value, market activity on the bracket
extremes will be met with responsive selling at the top, and responsive
buying at the bottom. “Responsive,” in this sense, refers to participants re-
sponding to the advertised opportunity of price above or below value, or
the mean.

Auctions that occur near bracket extremes provide signiﬁcant infor-
mation about the odds of the bracket holding. For example, if an auction
that pushes toward the upper extreme occurs on heavy volume, the odds
are high that the bracket will not be able to contain the upward movement.
Conversely, if low volume accompanies an auction at a bracket’s upper ex-
treme, then it is likely that higher prices are effectively cutting off activity;
higher prices are not being accepted as “fair,” the bracket’s extremes are
afﬁrmed, and more balancing activity can be expected.

A common reaction to this deﬁnition of brackets is this: Brackets are
easy to identify in hindsight. But how do you identify them as they are de-
veloping? The art of distinguishing real-time bracket activity is more than
a matter of drawing neat lines on a chart. It takes time to acquire this skill,
just as it takes time to learn to read an X-ray or master chess. With prac-
tice, however, you recognize the signs of balance and imbalance—perhaps
the most essential element of successful trading. Markets communicate
their need to balance via declining volume, thus the same information that

reveals the likelihood of bracket containment is also helpful for identify-
ing when a new bracket is beginning to form. One auction isn’t enough to
make this determination. As you become familiar with the auction process,
however, you’ll begin to fortify your ability to make this assessment.

From a trading standpoint, accurate bracket identiﬁcation provides im-
portant perspective; not only does it better equip you to take advantage
of well-deﬁned moves within the bracket (a trader’s paradise), but it also
helps you identify when the market is once again coming out of balance,
indicating that a new trend may be developing.

CLARITY IN THE MAELSTROM

It’s easy to lose yourself in short-term minutia, which can cause you to lose
track of the longer-term auction. We recommend that you print out a long-
term chart at least once a month and a weekly chart every Sunday. Post
them somewhere highly visible to help you keep the “big picture” in mind
as you continually assess your long-term strategies. Any time the market
departs the boundaries of one of these charts, immediately reprint them.

To illustrate how different market activity appears when viewed in the
context of different timeframes, Figure 5.3 displays a weekly bar chart for
the S&P 500 for a portion of the same time period shown in Figures 5.1
and 5.2.

I have been amazed over the years by the money managers whom
I have reviewed who pride themselves on the fact that they have abso-
lutely no charting capabilities in their research facilities. I recently read
a newsletter produced by a top research ﬁrm that discussed a vital indi-
cator they missed in their analysis of the Japanese markets over the past
several years—they stopped paying attention to what Japanese policymak-
ers were doing. And they weren’t alone: Japan’s deﬂationary period simply
lasted longer than the attention span of most investors. A periodic review
of long-term bar charts could have alerted savvy investors (and investment
ﬁrms) to the fact that change was taking place, and with change comes
opportunity.

The attempt to remain as objective and honest with ourselves as
possible about what is actually occurring in the markets—not what we
hope to see or need to see in order to justify our positions or past
pronouncements—is a natural, ongoing challenge for even the most expe-
rienced traders and investors. This may sound obvious; but we know from
experience that when multiple people are given the same set of facts, they
will invariably arrive at different conclusions. Why? Because our decision-
making process is always inﬂuenced by our past experiences, and it goes

without saying that everyone has a vastly different background. The point
is that it’s possible to check your inclinations by frequently referencing
the market’s long-term auctions, which should support your decisions. For
example, the research ﬁrm that was negative on Japan should have looked
for conﬁrmation of this opinion in the form of lower volume during upward
auctions, with no upside breakouts from the long-term balance. A cursory
review of the longer-term auction should have revealed—if their conclu-
sions had been correct—that upward movement was not straying far from
the lower balance area. Instead, just the opposite was occurring, but the
ﬁrm’s analysts stopped looking and lost sight of the bigger picture.

One way to identify the beginning or end of a longer-term auction is by
observing the market’s balancing periods. To reiterate, markets rarely per-
form an “about face,” moving from one sustained directional movement to
its opposite. For long-term investors who manage large portfolios, learning
to recognize when long-term auctions begin and end can be absolutely vi-
tal. And fortunately, the balancing process can take several months, for
the long-term auction, which allows time to reposition even the largest
portfolios. Failure to make use of this time, however, has destroyed many

solid track records—track records that can take years to rebuild. Once the
market leaves a balance area, price often moves rapidly (at least initially)
in a nonlinear fashion, liquidity shrinks and opportunity is lost.

It is worth noting here that a ﬁnancial market is different than a physi-
cal system like a motor. A car’s engine eventually wears out, but it remains
the same “system” no matter what is done to it. Conversely, a market is
constantly evolving based on the actions of its participants; cogent pat-
terns are eventually eliminated by those within the system acting upon it,
which explains trends and why they come to an end.

Enter Market Proﬁle, a simple visual manifestation of market activity
that changes constantly, objectively reﬂecting the evolving attitudes of all
participants in the present tense. Part of the beauty of the proﬁle—its el-
egance, even—is the simple fact that it records change. It is this liquidity-
capturing aspect that makes Market Proﬁle such a vital tool for interpreting
market activity.

The word liquidity generally refers to an individual’s ability to execute
an order, Here we use the term to address the constant ﬂux of funds into
and out of the market.

That’s worth reiterating: Market Proﬁle is different than most trad-
ing approaches because it is wholly liquidity driven. Market fundamen-
tals and technical patterning may be accurate or misleading, may evolve
and become anachronistic, but the fact remains: If funds are ﬂowing
into a market—whether it’s an individual security or a sector or an art
auction—then the market eventually auctions higher. If funds are ﬂow-
ing out, the market eventually auctions lower. There’s nothing new here,
just the primal law of supply and demand made manifest in a simple vi-
sual graphic that portrays the developing relationship of price, time, and
volume—a graphic that enables whole-brained investors to visualize when
a market is both in and out of balance.

The resulting proﬁle enables us to capture complex relationships so
that it’s possible to better understand what is actually happening in the
market in the present tense. The long-term bar charts presented in this
chapter serve a different function; because they only portray price, they
don’t capture all the additional complexities and behavioral attributes in-
corporated by Market Proﬁle. They do, however, provide crucial long-term
perspective when reviewed in conjunction with daily proﬁles, which add
the dimensions of time and volume.

THE BIG PICTURE

I use long-term bar charts to speed read the market’s “big picture” before I
narrow my focus on more granular, daily detail. For example, the bar chart

any range of days you want to examine. The signiﬁcance of the longer term
Proﬁle graphics will be discussed more fully in Chapter 6.

Figures 5.4 and 5.5 represent the same time period: March 14, 2006—
May 10, 2006. Figure 5.4, a daily bar chart, does not enable you to see, at a
glance, what is evident in Figure 5.5:

1. The three distributions (the broad areas of the proﬁle, where most

trade, i.e., volume, took place).

2. The mean of each distribution. Based on the discussion thus far, it
should be clear that volume measures the success or failure of each
auction; higher prices either cut off activity or, in strongly trending
markets, attract more activity. When higher prices cut off activity, price
generally reverts to the mean.

From another perspective, imagine that volume represents force. For
a market to successfully auction away from a fully developed distribution

71

area with a well-deﬁned mean (where buyers and sellers have agreed upon
value), the auction would need to have excessive force to overcome the
“gravitational pull” of that value area. If price exploration does not have
force—volume—then the expectation is that price will be pulled back to
the established distribution value area.

Peter Steidlmayer said that markets are not “efﬁcient,” but that they
are “effective.” By “effective,” he means that price has to auction too high
before the market realizes it’s too high, and too low before the market
realizes it’s too low. In effect, what happens is that price auctions higher
until there is a lone bidder; when higher prices cut off activity, then the
auction has gone too far.

Price is simply an advertising mechanism. Some advertisements are
successful and attract new business, while others are unsuccessful, serv-
ing to shut down activity. As we observe, via the market proﬁle, a market
auctioning away from an established distribution area, the question we’re
always trying to answer is this: Will a new distribution (value area) be es-
tablished or will price be pulled back to the prior distribution area? Again,
it takes the force made manifest in volume for the establishment of a new
value area to be successful.

While we have discussed long-term trends for a broader market, the
same concepts are applicable for sectors and individual securities as well.
Figure 5.6 shows the monthly bar chart of UBS (Union Bank of Switzer-
land), a global ﬁnancial services company, from May 2000 to May 2006.

UBS traded within a range of approximately $35 to $59 for three years;
long-term trends generally begin and end in just such intermediate-term
auctions. Notice that UBS traded within a very tight, approximately ﬁve-
dollar range for four months prior to the upward breakout from the three-
year bracket. Figure 5.6 shows this narrow balance area occurring just
before the start of an upward trend that, as of this writing (June 2006),
carried the stock to a high of $122. During the four months prior to the
breakout, it would have been easy to disregard UBS, as there appeared
to be limited trading opportunities and extremely low volatility. Once the
trend got under way, however, it exhibited all the characteristics we have
previously described—it began to trend, balanced from January to Novem-
ber 2004 and then resumed trending upward, balancing again from Decem-
ber 2004 through October 2005. In November 2005, UBS again began to
auction higher.

Any breakout from a balance area signals that a reevaluation of
value is occurring. Intermediate- and long-term timeframes may disre-
gard short-term balances; however, traders and investors of all timeframes
should pay careful attention to long-term breakouts, as they include par-
ticipants from all timeframes and can result in large momentum shifts.
Failure to recognize this principle can result in major losses and missed

opportunities, some of which can end careers. When a market sea change
is in the works, it is absolutely vital that you not only identify the coming
change, but that you position yourself correctly in order to weather (or
ride) the storm.

ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITIES AND RISK

The Efﬁcient Market Hypothesis (EMH) embodies the theory that new in-
formation is assimilated into the market so quickly that no single person
can consistently outperform the market as a whole. This leads to the the-
ory that the probability of a future price increase is exactly the same as a
future price decrease. And, of course, if this is correct, no one could ever
consistently forecast the market—a hypothesis supported by convincing
research. Carried to its logical conclusion, this line of thought precludes
value investing, which is based on the idea that prices travel away from
value. If EMH were true, value investing would have no merit, as all prices

would be constantly equal, negating the idea of “value” altogether. Growth
investing, which is based on continual upward growth, would also have no
utility, as it too requires practitioners to be successful at forecasting both
higher growth and higher prices.

One of the goals of this book is to provide a logical framework for
reconciling these divergent ideas. The discussion of timeframes, along
with the idea that price must only be fair in the day timeframe, enables
one to argue that the current, tradable price for any given security is, in
fact, the true and fair market price—given all the information available
at that moment for the shortest of timeframes (the intensely competitive
nature of market participants would allow for no other possibility). How-
ever, our position is that what is fair for the shortest timeframe partic-
ipant may, in fact, be viewed as an opportunity for a longer timeframe
participant.

Most of the investing world desperately wants to believe that there are
experts who can accurately forecast, and they are willing to pay dearly
for that advice. Obviously, there would be no need for art auctions, auc-
tions for Treasury securities, or auctions of any kind if prices could be
consistently, accurately forecast. That’s why we take a totally different
approach—one that is not dependent on forecasting, but on assessing the
risk of current auction continuation, stagnation, or reversal. For example,
we may say that the risk of holding a given long position is high, and pro-
vide an assessment of the odds of continuation—but we never attempt to
forecast future prices. The hardest thing to get your arms around is that
we don’t accomplish this risk analysis with absolute numbers; we employ
logical thinking to arrive at a practical assessment of risk asymmetries.
We believe that identifying exact numbers and probabilities is not possible
for any system that’s in a continual state of ﬂux. And furthermore, once
people have exact numbers to cling to, their minds tend to immediately
close to the present-tense modulations that can utterly belie their long-term
leanings.

We have stated that the market is not efﬁcient; however, the mecha-
nism for establishing the current tradable price—the auction process—is
the most effective mechanism for allocating securities to be traded among
those submitting bids and offers. Once the auction is underway, rather than
attempting to predict future prices, we instead observe as the market dis-
covers future prices. We continually assess the force and health of this
auction process in order to identify asymmetrical opportunities that can
provide optimal trade location—trade location with less risk. In an upward
auction, for example, we assess whether higher prices are cutting off activ-
ity or creating increased interest, driving prices higher. If higher prices are
increasing the bidding, the risk of holding that security is low. If you are
short that same security, however, the odds of suffering a loss are greatly

chapter05

increased. Similarly, if you are long and higher prices are beginning to cut
off activity, the risk of remaining long has increased.

We mentioned earlier that a bracket develops when the views of the
relevant timeframe buyers and sellers are closely aligned. In a bracket, the
odds of the market moving higher or lower around the bracket mean are
about equal. If the market auctions to the upper extreme of the bracket
and volume decreases signiﬁcantly, the odds for upward continuation have
greatly diminished. This is another way of demonstrating that not all prices
are equal. If all prices are not equal, then all opportunities—and attendant
risks—are not equal, either.

Thus the market, through the price discovery process of the auction
mechanism, presents us with both symmetric and asymmetric opportu-
nities and risks. Our primary objective, then, is to observe the market’s
symmetry—or lack of symmetry—and adjust our trading decisions based
on an ongoing assessment of the resultant risks.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT

Every reader has his or her own unique opinion about how much stock
price movement is a result of overall market conditions, capitalization size,
sector performance, or the security itself. We suspect that an acceptable
answer is “some or all of the above.” It is possible to construct a market
proﬁle for each of the above elements through indexes, individual securi-
ties, or ETFs. Reviewing each of these market perspectives using the pro-
cess described in this chapter, and determining the symmetric or asym-
metric opportunity/risk of each, will provide you with an objective view of
both your overall portfolio and the individual elements that make up your
portfolio.

This process is just one step in evaluating the risks and opportunities
that affect your proﬁtability. Sometimes the greatest risk is that you are
simply wrong in your analysis—like the ﬁrm that followed the Japanese
market. Perhaps the greatest risk of all is the risk of losing your objectivity
to the point that you begin cherry-picking positive information that sup-
ports your position, and ignoring negative information that runs counter to
your opinion. The greatest investment errors I have made over the years,
by far, have resulted from giving in to the tendency to acknowledge only
the information that supported my existing beliefs and positions.

Since I ﬁrst discovered it in 1994, I have kept a chart entitled “Per-
spective on Performance” on my wall to remind me just how much sec-
tor performance can vary. The chart tracks early 1994 performance num-
bers for 25 different sectors, and reports that the Dow Industrial was—2.13
percent, Wilshire Large Company Growth was –5.01, and the Russell 2000

chapter05

Growth was –10.09 percent. The company that produces the chart updates
and republishes it every year, and while the leaders and laggards change,
the basic message remains the same. This kind of variance makes it clear
that market opportunities vary greatly—which is why it’s vital that you im-
merse yourself in the same kind of methodical, objective analysis for the
overall market, as well as for individual securities and sectors. Without
context, the most accurate data in the world are worthless.

There aren’t very many top-performing money managers—if there
were, we couldn’t call them “top performers.” By improving your perfor-
mance by only a few percentage points, you can move away from the
middle of the pack where performance resembles a money toss. Imagine
where you would place in the long-term performance battle if you could
even slightly improve the placement and exit of every trade you make. As
we have shown, a lot of money is left on the table (lost) because most
traders and investors are operating with incomplete information. Like in
every endeavor, the greatest reward comes to those who recognize oppor-
tunity early; the market proﬁle is the key to being able to act before the
opportunity genie is completely out of the bottle.

ASSEMBLING THE BIG PICTURE: CONTEXT
WITHIN CONTEXT

This chapter is titled “Long-Term Auctions,” but we should note that there
is no absolute deﬁnition for “long-term,” “intermediate-term,” or “short-
term”—any such deﬁnition is speciﬁc to the context of each individual in-
vestor. There is no set duration for these categories, but they are helpful in
the abstract for analyzing market activity through different lenses.

In Chapter 2, we noted that fundamental information must be viewed
in the proper context to have relevance. The example we used to make this
point involved the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which, depending
on your perspective, could be fantastic or disappointing. Market-generated
information must also be viewed within the proper context. The market
only has to be fair in the day timeframe, which means there could be buying
conviction on a given day that will eventually be met with aggressiveness
in the opposite direction from the longer-timeframe seller—that’s why you
must stay focused on the longer-term context when analyzing daily market
behavior.

If you consistently employ the long-term bar chart analysis that we
covered in this chapter, you will have a much better chance of keeping that
“big picture” always in mind. However, as we will experience shortly, at
important junctures even the longest of timeframes must closely monitor
the day timeframe. We said earlier that there are times when it is more

important to be right. Nonlinear market, security, or sector moves can
make or break your yearly performance in the blink of an eye.

As we head into Chapter 6, we narrow our focus and examine some
telling short-term details for the S&P as it is in the process of making new
life-of-contract highs. In Chapters 7 and 8, we then begin to combine theory
with tactics—tactics that will help you learn how to monitor the different
timeframes in order to identify and capitalize on asymmetric opportunities
that reveal themselves in evolving market structure.

Complexity creates opportunity.

—Jim Dalton

I t is May 2006, and events occurring in the U.S. stock market have coin-

cidentally and unexpectedly converged with the topic of this chapter.
We couldn’t have asked for better examples than those the market is
providing right now, in real time. Convergence is a term we employ quite
often; it comes into play when a market is transitioning from bracket to
trend, or from trend to bracket. Such convergence is always accompanied
by increased volatility as the various timeframes join the fray, which often
leads to the kind of price movement that garners front-page news—such
as “Fed Derails Dow Record Reach,” which recently appeared in the Wall
Street Journal.

Before we dissect these unfolding events, however, let us ﬁrst take
a closer look at the bracketing process. In order to successfully navigate
intermediate-term auctions, you must ﬁrst understand the way they begin,
develop, and end.

CONVERGENCE AND THE
BRACKETING PROCESS

When a trend is coming to an end, the market begins a bracketing process,
which is the ﬁne-tuning of value beliefs between the long-term sellers and
buyers. During this process, the market auctions up and down until a fairly

well-deﬁned bracket is eventually formed. From time to time, there may
be slight bracket expansions upward and downward. But they generally
aren’t signiﬁcant until they occur on increasing volume, when a new trend
breaks out of the bracket. The difference between a “bracketing” market
and a “bracketed” market is a subtle point and vital to understanding the
way shifting forces inﬂuence market activity.

The tendency of markets to transition from trending to bracketing re-
cently revealed itself in the U.S. stock market. Through May of 2006, the
market had been in a longer-term upward trend for three years. However,
Figure 6.1 shows that, after recording new market highs on May 5 for the
S&P 500 and on May 10 for the Dow, the long-term buying auction con-
verged with longer-timeframe sellers on May 11, sending the equity mar-
kets down sharply and establishing the ﬁrst leg of a new bracket.

Claiming that a new bracket is being formed is actually a rather bold
statement, as it is too early at the time of this writing to actually conﬁrm
that a new bracket is developing. So far, we have observed only a nonlinear,
downward auction. For this auction to develop into a traditional bracket,

or “consolidating market,” we need to see a series of both higher and lower
intermediate-term auctions, a process that can expose the convictions of
long-term buyers and sellers.

In just a month, from the break after the contract high on May 5 to the
low on June 13, both the S&P and the Dow have fallen more than 8 percent,
with all indices at a loss for the year. That’s a signiﬁcant move—the kind of
move that can make or break one’s hard earned track record. What follows
is a review of the process that led up to this convergence, this transition
from trending to bracketing that became so easily recognizable on May 11
(in addition, we provide an update in Appendix A that summarizes the mar-
ket activity that occurred between the time this review was written and the
book went to press).

DEFINING THE INTERMEDIATE TERM

Earlier, we described ﬁve timeframes: scalper, day trader, short-term
trader, intermediate-term trader, and long-term trader. We gave general
guidelines for each of these timeframes in order to provide some comfort in
forming a structure for understanding how markets operate. We said that
intermediate-term markets could last for months, and that it isn’t always
the time, but rather the distance traveled that determines whether an auc-
tion is “intermediate.” Consider a bracket that develops over a four-month
period. A downward auction is met with the expected responsive buying at
the bracket’s lower extreme, and then the market auctions higher for four
consecutive weeks before reaching the bracket’s opposite extreme. We de-
scribe this as an “intermediate-term auction” or “swing trade.” Likewise,
if the market quickly reversed after nearing the upper extreme and fell to
the bottom of the bracket in just four days, this would also be considered
an intermediate-term auction. It is the distance traveled—not the length of
time—that determines the “intermediate-term” classiﬁcation.

The price range of an intermediate-term auction is generally greater
(from the low to the high) than that of a short-term auction. Another distin-
guishing feature of an intermediate-term auction is that it contains several
smaller, well-deﬁned balance areas, which become excellent short-term
trading ranges. Regardless of what you ultimately decide to deﬁne as ei-
ther “short-term” or “intermediate-term,” the key is that the auction in ques-
tion begins or occurs within a bracketing period. Once you’ve identiﬁed a
bracket, your trading strategy should be to look for swing trades on the
bracket’s extremes. In such a balancing environment, you should continue
to expect a series of two-way, or “swing” auctions.

It is instrumental to acknowledge that money managers who mar-
ket themselves as “long-term investors,” continually advising you to stay

fully invested, are in fact trend traders. Failure to distinguish between
trending and bracketing markets has historically been extremely costly
to trend traders. When the market is trending, of course, trend traders do
quite well, but when the market is bracketing—which we have estimated
to be in excess of 75 percent of the time—trend traders often give back a
healthy portion of what they made during the trend.

THE TRANSITION FROM BRACKET TO TRENDS

It is vital to be able to identify when a market is transitioning to a bracket,
and when a new trend has erupted from that balancing range. We be-
gin by reviewing the process that marks the transition from a bracket’s
intermediate-term auctions to a trend’s directional conviction. As you may
have already surmised, this is not an exact science.

A bracketed market is a market in balance. To reiterate, within a
bracket there is likely to be several smaller balance ranges that develop
through the shorter-term, two-way action process. When these smaller bal-
ance areas (which will be featured in Chapter 7) begin to cluster near the
extremes of the larger, intermediate-term bracket, this indicates that the
market is coming into tighter and tighter balance. While this isn’t always
the case, it is quite common for this type of clustering activity to represent
the ﬁnal stage in the transition from bracket to trend.

Figure 6.2 illustrates a tight balance range that led to an upside break-
out. As a general trading principle, I have found that if the balance range
corresponds to your timeframe, you should go with any breakout from that
balance and then monitor the trade for signs of continuation. The wider the
balance area from which the market transitions, the greater the number of
timeframes that are likely to be involved when the breakout ﬁnally occurs,
and the greater the odds that the ensuing move will be signiﬁcant.

If price is to remain contained within a bracket, we expect to see re-
sponsive action: participants “responding” to the advertised opportunity to
sell at the upper end of the bracket, at prices above the mean (value), and
to buy at the lower end, responding to price advertised below the mean.
However, just the opposite happens when a market is about to transition
from a bracket to a bull trend; higher prices generate more upward vol-
ume, leading to an upside breakout. Likewise, in a nascent bear trend,
lower prices actually attract additional selling instead of generating the
expected action—cutting off selling—which leads to a downside breakout
and trending conditions.

Trending markets, at least in their early stages, demonstrate a high de-
gree of conﬁdence that the current price is unfair—for the seller in an up-
ward trend, and for the buyer in a downward trend. With high-conﬁdence

cause only temporary setbacks (which can provide good buying opportu-
nities if the trend is up, for example), while releases that support the trend
generally serve to accelerate its progress.

Another way to deﬁne bracketed markets is that they have absorbed
and assimilated all current information, and that the long-term buyers
and sellers have basically arrived at an equal sense of value; the market
is marking time until new information arrives. In this state, the market
closely resembles the textbook “efﬁcient market.” It is not uncommon to
see a major news announcement, such as the monthly Bureau of Labor
Statistics’ employment report, have a signiﬁcant impact on a bracketed
market, while having little or no lasting impact in a trending market. A
major news release is frequently the ﬁnal factor that results in a transition
from bracket to trend. In other words, a bracketed market is in balance,
waiting for substantive new information before it begins its next major
directional auction.

THE TRANSITION FROM TREND TO BRACKET

Trends end in either of two ways or a combination of the two. The ﬁrst,
less-frequent type of ending occurs when volume—which is in the direction
of the trend—simply dries up, as if the participants that were driving the
directional move are “all in” and there is no one left to participate. The
transition is relatively quiet and calm; the market just sits there, lulling
market participants into a state of complacency and stasis.

In Figure 6.3, S&P futures traded at 1,269.70, 1,269, 1,269.40, and
1,269.90 during four out of ﬁve days prior to the intermediate-term auc-
tion changing direction. There was less than a full point separating those
four highs; the buying had simply dried up, and participants contributing
to the downward auction were a combination of long liquidators and new
shorts. Over the next 18 days the market declined to 1,223—a 3.62 percent
move—before beginning a rally that once again failed to exceed the 1,269
high-water mark. Before the initial decline was complete, the market had
dropped to a low of 1,180, a decline of 7 percent.

The creation of “excess” is the second and most common end to a
trend. Excess occurs when a market makes a dramatic price high or low on
low volume and opposing buyers or sellers react quickly and aggressively
by auctioning price in the opposite direction. This type of trend end is often
stormy and sudden, which results in a state of near panic as price moves
quickly and it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to make a decision that’s not
inﬂuenced by heightened emotion.

Figure 6.4 (on the following page) shows both types of auction-ending
patterns. In the ﬁrst two boxes from the left, volume simply dried up, and
in the next three boxes you see the second, more violent type of transition
marked by excess.

Following the excess high (identiﬁed in Figure 6.4), notice the cre-
ation of an extreme form of excess known as a gap. A gap (in price) is
created when the market does not have an opportunity (time) to trade at
certain prices. This happens in one of two ways: when the market auctions
so quickly in one directions that prices are skipped altogether, or when
market participants have changed their perception of value so dramatically
that they simply begin trading at a completely different price level.

In Figure 6.4, the S&P auction ended with an excess high, indicating
that price auctioned so high that it was deemed unfair for the buyer. The
excess gap on the following day provided further acknowledgment that
prices were indeed too high. A gap at the end of an auction that occurs
in the direction opposite the most recent trend signals a reorganization of
beliefs. As educational psychologist Frank Pajares summarizes Thomas S.
Kuhn’s groundbreaking work in The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions:

Transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new
tradition . . . can emerge is not a cumulative process. It is a recon-
struction of the ﬁeld from new fundamentals . . . It changes methods
and applications. It alters the rules.

In short, the laggards are ﬁnally “all in,” and the market moves with

real conviction.

An excess high or low occurs on light or low volume. Most of
the investing world, however, thinks the opposite is true. For exam-
ple, many investors believe that capitulation at the end of a downward
auction—when all the sellers ﬁnally sell—occurs on heavy volume. But
this would go against all the principles we’ve talked about. For example,
a market may experience a period of healthy volume as the stragglers
(Gladwell’s “late majority” or “laggards”) get rid of their inventory, but the
ﬁnal prices, manifest in the excess spike, are not made on heavy volume.
The volume most people incorrectly ascribe to capitulation is actually a
result of the action in the other direction, when buyers show up in force
and the price spike down is quickly rejected. Confusion occurs due to the
fact that after the excess high or low is in place, there is often a dramatic
pickup in volume as part of the counterauction.

THE CONVERGENCE OF INTELLECT
AND EMOTION

The most common true end to a trend—which also signals when a bracket
begins—occurs as a result of both a reduction in volume in the direction
of the trend and an excess high or low. The ending of an auction offers
the moment of greatest opportunity, as well as the moment of greatest
risk; both risk and reward are asymmetric at this pivotal point. If the trend
is downward and an auction low has been established, the investor who
correctly recognizes the low and buys has a low risk/high reward posi-
tion. Sounds easy, but imagine the emotions that these “innovators” must
endure when they buy against what has been universally acknowledged

chapter06

as a bear trend. The market has been auctioning fairly consistently one
way—down—for an extended period of time, and thus a decision to buy
utterly ﬂies in the face of common (as well as expert) wisdom. It’s not easy
to go against the crowd. As someone once said, being a contrarian is like
committing social suicide. To be a successful trader/investor, your intellect
and emotion must work as a team, which is easier said than done.

On a tick chart, this kind of trend-end reversal looks elongated, with
a ﬁnal price spike that is quickly rejected. If you’ve done your homework
and recognize that this spike is on low volume, your intellect can be saying
“now would be a low risk/high reward time to buy,” but when the speed
of the reaction takes your breath away, your emotions won’t always be in
agreement. This cognitive dissonance can freeze your trigger ﬁnger while
opportunity slips away.

The investor who is short in this example (for a long-only money man-
ager, “short” would mean holding cash, or being under committed to the
market), and who fails to recognize that the auction is ending, must en-
dure high risk and low reward; the ensuing rally is often sharp and fast.
If you are a large money manager and your analysis hasn’t revealed the
weakening auction, then once the reversal begins there is generally limited
liquidity, which can severely compromise your performance.

ACCELERATE THE LEARNING PROCESS

I had always marveled at the Apollo 12 moon mission, which was reported
to have landed within 15 meters of its target. I thought it was accomplished
by a room full of incredibly smart people who created an algorithm, ﬁred
the rocket into space, and waited until it landed on the moon. I was sur-
prised to read that the mission was off course 80 percent of the time, which
required continual course corrections. Without these on-the-ﬂy computa-
tions, the Apollo would have been lost in space.

When working with the natural sciences, there is comfort and stabil-
ity in the reproducibility of results, born of the constants inherent in sci-
entiﬁc inquiry. There is a genuine feeling of delight when the mind stum-
bles across the “correct answer.” The human mind is hardwired to seek
concrete answers. Moreover, our tendency is to acknowledge only those
answers that support our presupposed beliefs, which can lead to tunnel
vision, short-sightedness and, ultimately, plunging proﬁts.

The difference between the natural sciences and market-generated
analysis is that the elements we employ to conduct our analysis are con-
stantly evolving; the only constant we have at our disposal is change. Of
course, without change there would be no opportunity, and so we gladly

welcome change. But as a result, it takes an extraordinary amount of time
and dedication to become familiar with the type of analysis we’re describ-
ing in this chapter. There is no substitute for experience in any ﬁeld, of
course, but because of the many complexities and subtitles inherent in
trading, there is no quick way to gain that essential experience. It may ap-
pear to be misleadingly simple to move from novice to proﬁcient, as the
ideas we’re purporting in this book are not unfathomable. However, it takes
an incredible amount of dedication to elevate your trading level from pro-
ﬁcient to expert—and that’s what differentiates the all-stars from the herd.
Think of the difference between an average professional basketball player
and the elegance with which Michael Jordan could dominate a game. And
it is well documented that Jordan trained relentlessly, studying tapes, stay-
ing late in the gym, shooting free throws after he was totally fatigued to
simulate game scenarios.

To become a truly skilled investor or trader, you must immerse your-
self deeply in the market’s auction process, experiencing a variety of sim-
ilar situations until you begin to understand how that process works in
a real-time, present-tense perspective. If you observe only long-term mar-
kets, it will take years before you will have seen and recorded enough pat-
terns to competently recognize transitioning activity, let alone be able to
act on that information while balancing intellect and emotion. However,
recall that everything we’ve discussed thus far is applicable to all time-
frames; to accelerate the learning process, we suggest that you also study
short-term markets, analyzing the shorter-timeframe balances that occur
within intermediate-term brackets. This will give you increased conﬁdence
about the entire auction process, as well as further insight into the actions
and motivations of the various timeframes.

PRELUDE TO A SEA CHANGE

Having examined how trends begin and end, let’s now look at the securi-
ties markets as they converged with our writing Markets in Proﬁle in May
2006, when the U.S. equity market was entering its fourth year of an ex-
tended longer-term up trend. After the markets closed on Friday, May 5,
I commented to a long-time friend and Chicago-based trader, William
Kennedy, that everything we look at to analyze auction strength and con-
ﬁdence was leading me to assess the risk—from the long side of the
market—as being very high. The upward auction, despite accomplishing
higher price movement, was accompanied by continually decreasing vol-
ume, and the volume was not well distributed throughout the market pro-
ﬁle. As a result I had refused to trade from the long side for the previous
two weeks. Additionally, I commented to Bill that trading from the short

chapter06

side was also risky, as there had been no sign of sellers—only marginal
buying activity. The greatest point of market opportunity is when you feel
alone. Given the high risk of being outright long, and the fact that longer
timeframe sellers had yet to surface, I purchased out-of-the-money puts
with extended time, feeling that the market would at least have to auction
lower to determine if buyers remained present under the current price lev-
els.

Remember the subtlety in what we do: we don’t forecast, we assess
the risk of our positions. We seek to exit positions that have above-average
risk, and to establish positions that provide favorable risk/reward charac-
teristics. Once a position has been established, we then monitor the auc-
tion process for continuation. There was no expectation that the May 2006
decline would develop as it did; an auction continues until it is completed.
Let’s further this discussion by reviewing a strong upward trending
market, so that we’ll have something against which to compare the May
auction.

Figure 6.5 exhibits the pattern of a strong, upward trending market.
Notice how the market trends upward, balances, then resumes its upward
trend again and again. The stronger the trend, the greater the distance
between successive balance areas. As the auction ages, this distance de-
creases. In the late stages of the trend, price may continue to rise but the
next balance area will often be resting on top of or within the prior, lower
balance area.

Long-term trends often resemble stairs, with each balancing area rep-
resenting a step. Downward auctions appear as if they are descending a
staircase, as you can see in the daily bar chart of Figure 6.6 . Figure 6.5, a
rising trend, reveals an ascending staircase pattern. Note that the same se-
curity, displayed via a different time interval, looks entirely different. That’s
why we suggest that you review each security you trade using monthly,
weekly, and daily bars—it broadens your perspective and assist, you in
identifying your own timeframe.

As the downward auction becomes exhausted in Figure 6.6, note that
the lower balance area overlaps the previous, higher balance area. This
doesn’t mean that the downward auction is over; rather, that it is late
in the process, and so the corresponding risk of holding short positions
has increased. If you’re a long-term portfolio manager, at this late point in
a downward auction the risk of holding defensive securities or cash has
risen, and you would want to begin to commit to new positions or add to
favorable positions. Long-term returns are greatly enhanced by committing
cash at lower levels, as long as the auction is ending.

Trends that are growing “tired” will begin to exhibit increased volatility
without producing much further directional progress. Additionally, volume
will begin to decrease and, in some cases, auctions that are in the direction

Having reviewed these two auction patterns, let’s look at the monthly

(balance) between the high established in March 2000 and the low created
in October 2002. While the market has, in fact, stayed within an extremely
broad bracket between the March 2000 high and the October 2002 low, it
has steadily risen since an upside breakout in March 2003, a period exceed-
ing three years. Few have the patience or perspective to say that a three-
year rally is not a bull market; even though it remains contained within the
longer-term bracket. (The practical thing for a money manager to do is to
treat it like a bull trend, because if he doesn’t, he won’t retain any clients.)
John Mauldin, in Bull’s Eye Investing: Targeting Real Returns in a Smoke
and Mirrors Market (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 2004), tells us that it
is not uncommon for markets to consolidate for years. In fact, he writes
that the shortest period of consolidation following a bear market is eight
years. We are now in year six, and when we ﬁnally break out of the March

2000 through October 2002 bracket, we would expect an extremely active
market.

The strategies you employ for a trend and a bracket are quite different,
but there are times when the market is tricky, exhibiting elements of both.
The “ﬁnal answer,” as it were, is to remain ﬂexible and open-minded, and
if you want to excel as a money manager, don’t be a trend trader, stick-
ing only to long positions—there is a big difference between buying and
holding and staying fully invested. The last report I saw on money man-
agers’ holdings revealed that the average position was held for less than
a year. For the most part, it seems, money managers aren’t really “buy-
ing and holding” as much as they are staying fully invested. While I was
at UBS Financial Services, the team that researched money managers re-
ported to me, and I have monitored the rate of money manager turnover for
years, and while there have been a few managers that did exclusively buy
and hold securities for extended periods, I have observed that this prac-
tice is certainly not the norm. In other words, being more market sensitive
than dogmatic is not unheard of—which is the core of what we’re trying

chapter06

to impart. Even while money managers are selling customers on the idea
of buying and holding, there is more nuance to it than that: there is market
awareness.

If you measure the price distance from the top to the bottom of the
trend line for the S&P 500 shown in Figure 6.7, you will notice that the
difference is approximately 5 percent. This distance is commonly referred
to as a channel. When volatility increases, which expands the channel, it
is not uncommon to see a difference of 8 to 10 percent. Common theory
would suggest that you buy a pullback to the bottom of the channel in
an upward trend, and sell a rally to the top of the channel. The challenge
is that if you don’t hedge, and instead ride out the decline to the bottom
of the channel, and it turns out that there is a downside breakout from
there, you’ve already given back a gain (if you even had one going into the
correction). Worse, if you weren’t on the plus side as the decline began, it
would take a strong rally just to get you to back to the break-even point.
This is where money managers can get into big trouble—their emotions
say, “I can’t sell now; the market’s got to turn around.” But once you enter
that head space, you’ll be lucky if you can keep your relative standing, and
your absolute performance will be shot.

Now let’s view the S&P 500 through a shorter-term lens, a daily bar

chart shown in Figure 6.8.

The S&P 500 futures contract broke out to the upside on November
18, 2005 on reported volume in the Wall Street Journal of more than
2 billion shares. To provide some reference, typical daily volume during
this period ranged from 1.6 to 2 billion shares (although there were cer-
tainly a few days above and below these levels). A breakout on high vol-
ume, with the close near the daily high, indicated that higher prices were
attracting more activity, which means the auction would be expected to
continue higher—which it did for three more days.

The world spends a lot of time searching for easy answers, and near
the end of 2005 most ﬁnancial talk show guests were predicting a yearend
rally, which then became the “Christmas rally.” This talk wasn’t enough to
actually empower the rally, so hints of a Fed pause were thrown into the
mix. Media-generated situations often set up excellent opportunities for
diligent investors who can observe the proceedings objectively, without
getting emotionally caught up in the media-generated hype.

A review of Figure 6.8 shows that the market ﬁrst balanced above the
November breakout low for approximately six weeks before staging an-
other upside breakout. Following this new upward auction, the market’s
second balance was established slightly above, but still well within, the ﬁrst
balance—an indication that the trend was aging, but not necessarily over.
The second balance occurred over the ﬁrst two-and-a-half months of 2006.

On March 15, a third upside breakout took place with resulting balancing
action similar to the second balancing period. As new highs were contin-
uing to provide comfort to investors, encouraging complacency, market-
generated information (time, price, volume) was revealing that the risk of
holding long positions was increasing. For those that focus primarily on
earnings, additional comfort arrived in the form of strong reports of in-
dividual company and S&P Composite earnings. At the time, a prominent
speaker from a money management ﬁrm told a daily business show that if
investors “keep focusing on earnings, we will be all right.” Based on how he
addressed the commentator, he probably knew that hype had outstripped
reality, but he also understood that if he said anything clearly negative it
could hurt his business. I think he was trying to be honest in a diplomatic
way, because the will of the herd is a force to be reckoned with, even when
it’s facing the wrong way.

Opportunities, just like markets, are regulated by time. If you squander
that time waiting for conﬁrmation, the consequences can be harsh. Once
the investing world recognizes that change is underway, it is usually too
late for large money managers to take advantage of it, as liquidity dries up
and the “change” becomes the “norm.”

HEAR THE BELLS A-RINGING

On May 8, 2006, the Wall Street Journal’s “Evening Wrap” quoted Merrill
Lynch economist David Rosenberg: “There is no question that the quarter
earnings season has been superb.” The article stated that quarterly results
for more than 400 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index are in,
and on average their per-share earnings were 14 percent higher than a year
ago, according to Thomson Financial. It also referenced Thomson report-
ing that the quarter was the 11th straight period of double-digit earnings
growth for the S&P 500. Mr. Rosenberg, according to the Journal, “noted
that analysts are already marking up their earnings forecasts for quarters to
come.” Just three days later, on Thursday, May 11, the stock market began
its signiﬁcant move down. The point is that while earnings are important,
so is market structure when assessing risk. Unfortunately, articles about
weak market structure aren’t very sexy, and are easily dismissed as “tech-
nical analysis.”

When we started writing this chapter in early May, we talked about the
market converging. By the time we were in the editing phase it was mid-
June and the decline had continued. From the high on May 5 to the close
on Tuesday, June 13, the S&P futures contracts were off 8.18 percent and
the Dow futures were off 8.58 percent. Still, the “experts” clung to their for-
mer beliefs. A typical Wall Street Journal quote from a company president
said he believed the Dow’s pullback was only “temporary,” and that the
index would close at over 12,000 by the end of the year. Isn’t that comfort-
ing? Another Wall Street Journal headline read: “Fed Derails Dow Record
Reach.” There always has to be a scapegoat, so everyone can externalize
their angst and anger. After all, it would be too esoteric to blame the mar-
ket’s decline on “weak structure.” It can’t be said often enough: you must
develop a holistic understanding based on the market’s real-time structure
in order to separate yourself from the pack and become a truly competitive
money manager.

COUNTERTREND AUCTIONS

Another sign that the upward trend had aged was provided by observing
the countertrend auctions—auctions that, in many cases, were stronger
than those that occurred with the trend. Figure 6.9 shows the ﬁnal days
prior to the nonlinear move that began on May 11, 2006.

On Friday, May 5, S&P futures broke out to the upside, establishing
a new life-of-contract high. Volume on this day, as reported in the Wall

(focus area).

Street Journal following the close, was 1.6 billion shares—at the low end
of the range we discussed earlier. If the market was attracting new buyers
and had any real underlying strength, an upside breakout to new life-of-
contract highs should have exceeded the upper end of the volume range.
Investors often lament that “No one rings a bell at the top of the market.”
But in a sense, the low volume that accompanied the upside breakout was
that bell.

During the ﬁrst three days of the following week, the S&P high was
not exceeded, although the Dow did manage to barely establish a new
peak. In terms of assessing the risk of holding a long position, once a
market attempts and fails to auction above a bracket high, the odds are
good that sellers will emerge and auction price downward and explore
the opposite end of the bracket. In other words, the odds were stacked
against those holding long positions. If you recall, at the beginning of
the chapter we made the statement that a new bracket had been formed
once excess was created and the market began a nonlinear move to the

downside. When an auction attempt fails to establish value in one direc-
tion, and price re-enters a previously accepted value range, the odds are
good that the market will auction down and explore the opposite end
of the accepted range. Looking back at Figure 6.9, we would deﬁne a
composite bracket made up of the three previous, interwoven balance
ranges.

On May 11, the S&P began its nonlinear descent, and as of the close on
June 13 the market had already declined more than 8 percent. Was some of
this capital destruction avoidable? We think so. While the world was talk-
ing about the Dow being only 80 points from historic highs and analysts
were marking up their forecasts, there where many anomalies that should
have been raising questions and ringing bells; yet it was not until after the
fact that the experts appeared with the answers. Some of the experts said
that the drop was because the market didn’t like what the new Fed chair-
man, Ben Bernanke, brought to the party. But obvious clues to the mar-
ket’s eroding structure had been creeping in since early December, long
before the world had a look at the new chairman. In our interpretation of
market-generated information, we saw continuously overlapping balance
ranges, low volume, poor volume distribution among the daily proﬁles, and
counter auctions that were at least equal to auctions with the trend—just
to mention a few of the factors that led to our conclusion that the upward
trend could not continue. Our question is this: While the talk shows were
clearly providing us with a surplus of information and hype, where was the
intellect?

THE QUEST TO DO BETTER THAN “NORMAL”

In The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions, Thomas S. Kuhn describes
major shifts in scientiﬁc theory as occurring when some new set of
circumstances—an anomaly—violates “normal” expectations. This change
is initially (and ﬁercely) resisted by all those invested in what was previ-
ously considered scientiﬁc “fact.” Malcolm Gladwell would argue that this
dynamic occurs in every type of human endeavor, with the “innovators”
ﬁrst to recognize that a major shift is occurring. These innovators, in both
the scientiﬁc and ﬁnancial realms, are generally rebuffed by the majority
that have a (literally) vested interest in the status quo. But eventually the
change that has taken place is recognized by everyone—even the “late ma-
jority” and the “laggards,” who get on board long after there is any signiﬁ-
cant opportunity to take advantage of the change.

The major shift in market sentiment that occurred in May 2006 is a
prime example of such a change. The ﬁnancial media, the columnists, the

arm-chair analysts, nearly all of them were in agreement about the fact that
the market was going to rip through those historic highs. Unfortunately for
them, and anyone else who got long on their advice, the market had other
ideas—a new set of circumstances had developed, which were visible for
those who knew where, how and when to look. The buyers were ﬁnally “all
in” (the aforementioned “capitulation”). And while human nature dictates
that no one ever wants to be ﬁrst into the breach, sellers did emerge, and
the market did a major about face.

Relative return managers are often caught by moves such as the one
just described. (Relative return refers to how an asset class performs rela-
tive to a benchmark.) That is because their clients—which include pension
funds, endowments, foundations, and individuals—are quick to penalize
managers who miss signiﬁcant upward market moves. As a result, most
managers attempt to stay fully invested during signiﬁcant rallies (such as
the three-year rally preceding the break). Portfolio managers and invest-
ment ﬁrms don’t just risk a little “under performance” at these moments,
but rather a signiﬁcant decline in their business, which sometimes proves
to be fatal.

When money managers get too bearish, stay out of the market, and
miss the next leg up, their reputation (not to mention their self-conﬁdence)
gets damaged. For those that develop an understanding of market struc-
ture, which provides a strong foundation upon which to build rational de-
cisions, some of the inherent risks in investing can be diminished—which
could be the difference between being successful and being a footnote in
the history books.

OH, THE DIFFERENCE A FEW POINTS MAKES

We have spent a lot of time demonstrating the difference between trend-
ing and bracketing markets, and as you recall, we referred to major trends
as long-term, and bracketing markets as intermediate-term—two distinct
timeframes. We have also discussed the distinction between risk and fore-
casting. We never know how high or low a market will go (that job is
handled expediently by the auction process), but we can assess the re-
sulting risk to existing positions. It is paramount to seek conﬁrmation in
the market’s unfolding present-tense structure; by observing market move-
ment and volume in relation to the mean, it is possible to monitor auctions
for continuation. Days in the direction of the auction timeframe you are
trading should result in better volume, progressive value-area migration,
and more elongated Market Proﬁle shapes.

To recap, if a market is trending upward and higher prices are attract-
ing new buyers and additional volume, then the mean is continually rising.

If the opposite is true, and higher prices are attracting less volume, then
it becomes apparent that the mean has remained well below the current
price, which means the odds are high that price will return to those levels.
If you can identify when the odds are changing and then act on that
knowledge, then you have a meaningful advantage over the majority of
investors who wait until proof is incontrovertible before making a move.
In the highly competitive investment business, the reward—even if only a
few percentage points—can be very signiﬁcant.

—Rudyard Kipling

B efore we plunge into short-term trading, let’s take a few steps back

and look at a continuum we call the trader development spectrum.
Understanding the way the different timeframes process and inter-

pret information helps you begin to identify your own unique timeframe:

Ĺ Long-term strategy
Ĺ Intermediate-term strategy
Ĺ Short-term trading
Ĺ Day trading
Ĺ Scalping

Long-term trades or investment ideas are made from a slower, more
logical analytical approach, with little attention paid to short-term details.
At the other end of the spectrum, scalpers rely mostly on the uncon-
scious mind, with rote memorization and keen reﬂexes being paramount
skills—long-term information is far too slow and cumbersome to be con-
sidered in the frenzy of the daily grind.

Intermediate- and short-term trading requires the most attention and
agility because successfully trading in these timeframes requires retaining,

recalling, and managing large quantities of information, some of which are
part of a long and complex series of events and indicators. Real-time data,
culled from present tense market structure, often reveal additional signiﬁ-
cance in data that we’ve already seen and processed. When old information
is bombarded with a constant ﬂow of new data, it takes an agile mind to
continually assess and reassess both the big picture and the minutia of the
daily auctions.

Longer-term trading is often enhanced by not looking too closely at
the smaller pieces of information, while day trading requires that you im-
merse yourself in short-term market conditions so you can react quickly
and intuitively to the day’s evolving data. We’re in no way suggesting that
day trading is “easier,” rather, that it requires parsing data that may not
be as complex and interrelated as the information germane to longer-term
investing.

Take a moment to think about your own thought processes as they re-
late to the different phases of the Trader Development Spectrum described
above. Are you beginning to understand where your individual strengths
(and weaknesses) would ideally place you on the timeframe continuum?
The “analyst” will likely be frustrated attempting to day trade, while the in-
tuitive trader, with strong reﬂex skills, will probably be equally frustrated
with the prospect of trading the longer timeframes. It’s simple in theory,
but difﬁcult in practice: in addition to knowing the market, you’ve got to
know yourself.

No matter what timeframe you ultimately trade, the market proﬁle pro-
vides you with a visual manifestation of market activity—the unfolding pat-
terns that capture complex information in a manner consistent with the
brain’s mechanism for understanding complex information. Having access
to a tool that so cohesively sums the actions of all market participants is
simply indispensable for keeping your head about you, especially during
times of crisis when your blood pressure soars and opportunity is ﬂeeting.
One last thought before we begin to explicate short-term market ac-
tivity: Perhaps the most important skill you must master to become a
successful trader is the ability to distinguish “price” from “value.” This
is something expert traders do intuitively, and Market Proﬁle does by its
very nature, organizing information from the entire timeframe spectrum in
a way that enables you to visualize how value is building and migrating.
While separating price from value is the hardest concept to internalize, it
is absolutely essential to understanding and effectively employing market-
generated information.

Remember, the auction’s fundamental purpose is to advertise oppor-
tunity (price), fairly and efﬁciently allocating bids and offers among the
market’s participants. As you gain experience reading market-generated
information via a market proﬁle in the “present tense”—as it unfolds—you

will learn to interpret price in context, which is the key to successfully
trading in any timeframe.

ANALYZING SHORT-TERM MARKETS

Short-term trading has no formal deﬁnition; a short-term trade can last a
day or several days, even weeks. But no matter what timeframe you’re op-
erating in, you are a day trader on the day you enter or exit a trade. And
good day-timeframe trade location, enhanced by a sound understanding of
the auction process, contributes to good performance for all timeframes.
Now let’s dig in.

We’ll begin by analyzing the preceding days’ activity in order to deter-
mine good trade location for the current day—the day you intend to trade.
Like top professionals in any sport, you must analyze past action in order
to be truly competitive; tennis star Andre Agassi analyzed endless match
ﬁlms before he ever faced an opponent. The same holds true in the invest-
ing realm: securing good trade location has as much to do with understand-
ing the market’s prior behavior as it does with effectively analyzing activity
on the day you trade.

On Day 3 in Figure 7.1, notice where the market opened—well above
the previous day’s close and accepted value. This will serve as an early im-
portant reference point, along with the previous day’s high and the fact that
that the previous day’s market proﬁle shape is broad, or “fat.” Remember,
for the market to ﬁnd acceptance away from a well-established mean it
needs power, manifest in volume. The more pronounced the mean—such
as the wide center point of Day 2 in Figure 7.1—the more signiﬁcance you
should attach to it; a wide mean essentially acts as an anchor, because
a large number of market participants have agreed that price was fair to
both sides at that level. When a day exhibits a broad market proﬁle, unless
the following day’s auctions occur on high volume, the odds are good that
price will revisit the gravitational center of that mean.

On Day 3—the day we’re going to “trade”—the market opens just be-
low the high of day two. After exploring above this reference point, respon-
sive sellers quickly return price to the center of the previous day’s value
area, where the pronounced mean from Day 2 exerts its pull. In order to
secure good execution for trades to be entered or exited on this day, you
should have started by reviewing the previous day’s activity, followed by
a review of overnight activity, in order to get an idea of where the open-
ing was expected to occur. As we have stated in previous chapters, you
should have also determined if the market was balancing or trending. If
balancing, you should have carefully noted balance area highs and lows, as
well as longer-term reference points. If trending, you should have noted the

direction and conviction of the trend. All of this information should be
known but kept in the background; too much attention to speciﬁc de-
tails can blur your short-term analysis. After the market opens, you should
be looking for a place to sell above value relative to the previous day
if you’re looking to short, or buy at or below value if you’re looking
to buy.

Markets are much more understandable if you think of price as simply
an advertising mechanism; you want to learn how to gauge the market’s
collective response to each ad, as it were. Unfortunately, most traders fo-
cus solely on price, not its qualiﬁcations, and it’s no secret how “most”
traders perform, in the long run.

On Day 4 in Figure 7.1, the market opened by advertising price below
the value area for the previous day. This price was quickly accepted by
responsive buyers, as evidenced by the single print buying tail in y period.
Buyers would need to act quickly on this day, while sellers would probably
have time on their side. Which brings up an important (and oft-mentioned)
point: probability and intelligent risk/reward are not the same thing. It is
not unusual, for example, for me to correctly assess that a market has ex-
tremely high odds of auctioning upward, yet I’ll be in the process of short-
ing that same market. Why? Because the current, short-term auction, while
bullish, may ultimately be providing a greater, lower risk opportunity to
place a short. This is applicable to all timeframes. What we’re saying, in
this case, is that while the odds of the market continuing higher in the very
short term are good, the amount of price appreciation remaining is rela-
tively small in relation to the risk of price destruction, once the current
auction ends.

For example, let’s estimate the odds of the market moving higher
at 75 percent with the potential to earn an additional 3 percent. How-
ever, because the upward price movement is occurring very late in the
overall auction, a break from this level could easily produce a 20 per-
cent loss. As this is being written, the New York Times is reporting that
small caps are down more than 10 percent and emerging markets more
than 20 percent since the beginning of May. There was clearly a point,
while these markets were topping out, when late investors were buy-
ing and still seeing gains. However, the potential reward—relative to the
risk—was not acceptable. In fact, an auction usually isn’t over until we
see one last upward spike that draws in the remaining buyers (Gladwell’s
laggards).

When we use the term odds, we’re not referring to odds calculated
via prescribed rules of mathematics, but odds based upon logic. If higher
prices are causing investors to become less aggressive in their buying, then
logic says that the auction is likely to stall and eventually reverse. If higher
prices are causing investors to become more aggressive, then logic says
that the auction is likely to continue, perhaps even accelerate. What we’re
describing is a process based on how we observe investors’ actions as they
are manifest in a multidimensional graphic that combines price, time, and
volume—the market proﬁle.

As we move deeper into our discussion of short-term trading, we
will continually examine how trade location determines the risk of
change inherent in each trade. We are always in search of asymmetric
opportunities—which simply means that the odds of success are greater
than 50 percent, and that the potential win would be greater than the po-
tential loss. In fact, if we were to rank the importance of the informa-
tion we have shared with you here in Markets in Proﬁle, the concept of

chapter07

asymmetric opportunities would rank right at the top—it’s the theme of
successful investing.

COMMON MIND TRAPS

is
An
understanding—and avoiding—some of the common traps your brain
can set for you. The ﬁrst is a natural tendency to believe that if some-
thing has been occurring for some time—a trend relevant to your
timeframe—then it is likely to continue. You believe that repetition is
effectively predicting future events, and with this insight into the future
you establish a trade in the direction of the trend. We have provided ample
material to support a case for making better judgments, but memories
are short, and the longer something has been reiterating, the less risk is
involved (or so we imagine). We recently experienced this in the emerging
markets, which rose by approximately 20 percent in the ﬁrst four months
of 2006; gold increased in value by approximately 40 percent and copper
prices doubled. But of course investors didn’t concern themselves with
risk, choosing instead to focus solely on return. Was there a way for
short-term traders to participate in these advances, as well as the ensuing
breaks that carried these markets sharply lower? Yes, indeed—by applying
the same auction logic we’ve discussed throughout the book, and not
caving in to the immediacy of emotional wish fulﬁllment. As long as higher
prices continue to attract more volume and the consecutive balance areas
are distinctly higher, then the odds of the auction continuing upward are
high. Similarly, as long as lower prices continue to attract more volume
and the balance areas are distinctly lower, then the odds of the auction
continuing downward are high.

The second trap investors fall prey to is over-simplifying the data,
which can have the effect of providing a view directly opposite of what
is actually occurring, which can of course lead to the mismanagement of
opportunities and risks. For example, since Market Proﬁle was ﬁrst for-
mally introduced by the Chicago Board of Trade in 1982, numerous ser-
vices have sprung up that attempt to offer trading services based on this
innovative tool. These services claim to provide you with hard and fast
rules about what to do with each market proﬁle pattern, such as buying
and selling tails, range extension, etc. They will also attempt to predict
the range of each time period, based on the “average” of these time peri-
ods in the past. There’s an old adage about the man with his head in the
freezer and his feet in the oven who says “Well, my average temperature is
just right.”

But there is always the hope that this time it’s different.
It is human to crave predictability. Unfortunately, predictability—like
being average—can be the end of your trading life. Everything is always
different, to some degree. Context is always changing. You can’t be suc-
cessful over the long haul by applying formulated solutions to a market in
constant ﬂux.

We believe that success relies heavily on one of two things: being in the
right market at the right time, and/or having the right skills for the current
market cycle. There are great bull-market traders and there are great bear-
market traders, but how often are they one and the same? There are phe-
nomenal volatility traders and there are those traders who fold when the
market heats up. In short, we realize that different skills are better adapted
to certain types of markets, but the way to increase your odds of long-term
success is to become a whole-brained trader, with skills that apply to any
type of market. It all starts with looking at the right information in the right
context and developing an objective, probability-based approach to trad-
ing.

WHEN AND WHERE TO LOOK FOR
SHORT-TERM TRADES

We can teach and study endless details, but never make the markets come
to life. The market proﬁle enables us to see these details in their proper
context by giving form to market activity. To make sense of this informa-
tion, it’s important to be involved in the process that forms the proﬁle.
Those who stay with it will soon begin to visualize the completed proﬁle
before the day is over. When this ﬁrst happens, you will experience the
joy of creativity, just as you’re making a nonlinear leap in your learning
process.

It should be clear by now that the one thing the market is not is
predictable. It would be comforting to describe speciﬁc patterns to look
for, as well as hard rules on what to do when those patterns occur. Un-
fortunately, it’s not that simple—every day the market opens and is in-
ﬂuenced by new circumstances, new participants, new contributing fac-
tors. In short: everything is always different. This is especially true in
short-term trading where every piece of new information is important,
and may or may not inﬂuence market behavior. Thus, for much of the
balance of this chapter, we will take you through a series of short-term
trading opportunities—as they unfolded—providing you with access to the
thinking, analytical framework, and play-by-play commentary of real-life
scenarios.

OPPORTUNITIES AROUND
INTERMEDIATE-TERM BRACKETS

Good short-term trades often occur within, or on the fringes of,
intermediate-term brackets, and might include the following . . .

Ĺ Breakouts from balance. Figure 7.2 shows a breakout from a balance
area following an inside day (an inside day occurs when the most re-
cent day’s range is entirely contained within the previous day’s range).
This scenario can be a high-probability trade. As Figure 7.2 shows, the
key is to monitor the auction closely for continuation once the break-
out occurs.

Ĺ Fading bracket extremes. Nonsymmetric trading opportunities—those
that offer signiﬁcantly higher potential return than risk—are often
afforded by fading (going against) a recent auction in which price
“hangs” at one of the extremes of a range deﬁned by multiple days
of overlapping value. It is the opposite of a breakout trade, when price
auctions to one extreme of the balance on decreasing volume.

Ĺ In Figure 7.3, the market rallied to new recent highs and then bids sim-
ply dried up. Because it often takes traders some time to get over the
inﬂuence of price, the market will just hang around like this until the
realization grows that the rally is over. And once this realization sinks
in, you have limited time to act. Homework is a beautiful thing.

Ĺ Bracket breakouts. Figure 7.4 shows a breakout from an intermediate-
term bracket—an identical trade for intermediate and long-term
traders (versus breakouts from balance areas); at major breakouts,
multiple timeframes converge and volatility increases.

I don’t have hard and fast deﬁnitions for “intermediate term” or “long
term,” but I’m willing to go with nearly any breakout from balance. Like-
wise, I will fade a balance area extreme if volume doesn’t support the
auction’s advertisement at that price level. And then there are those oc-
casions where the market is in total balance and volume doesn’t disclose
any meaningful information, in which case I simply wait for a new auction
to begin.

market-generated information. In many ways, technical analysis is the an-
tithesis of how we approach markets and trading because it fails to in-
clude time and volume, which enable the visualization of market structure.
A classic example would be a moving average, which is one of the most

popular technical tools. A simple moving average is constructed by using
the average price of a tradable security over a deﬁned period of time. A
ﬁve-day moving average, for example, would be calculated by adding the
closing prices for the past ﬁve days and dividing by ﬁve. Our aversion to
moving averages is based on the fact that they treat all prices as equal; they
fail to distinguish between prices made on low or high volume and what
direction the market was attempting to auction that day, which can result
in very misleading information.

Let’s expand on moving averages by examining Bollinger Bands, which
are based on the classic idea that price will revert to the mean. The bands
consist of two channels and a center line, which represents an exponen-
tial moving average. The bands represent a standard deviation above and
below the moving average, which is considered the true value, or mean.
The upper and lower bands then become price targets. In an upward trend,
for example, when price rotates to the lower band, the security is thought

to be oversold, which indicates a buying opportunity. Our concern is that
the moving average is based on price alone, which doesn’t give a true pic-
ture of how the mean migrates. The market proﬁle is based on time, price,
and volume, which provides a more comprehensive means of observing the
mean’s progression.

We have similar concerns about mathematically derived technical in-
dicators like Fibonacci numbers. This doesn’t mean such indicators are
invalid; in fact, we follow many of them closely because they can provide
solid trading information. For example, recently the S&P 500 was trading
around its 200 day moving average, and as a result there was increased
volatility due to the fact that this moving average is widely followed by
investors, traders, and hedge fund managers. For example, in May–June
2006, many of the market experts thought that the 200-day moving average
would support the May–June 2006 market break. What we saw via market-
generated information and the market proﬁle was that as the market auc-
tioned lower, volume increased, while on rallies volume decreased—data
that suggested the 200-day moving average would be taken out, which is
exactly what happened (and quickly). The fact that a large number of mar-
ket participants are focusing on a certain level or indicator increases the
odds that we will at least witness increased volatility when that indicator
is in play, and with volatility comes opportunity.

There were certainly successful traders in the world long before Mar-
ket Proﬁle arrived. We maintain, however, that successful traders have al-
ways understood that higher prices on decreasing volume will eventually
spell trouble. It doesn’t require studying a proﬁle to realize that as you ap-
proach any market reference point—whether it be a long-standing high or
low or a standard technical indicator—it is more likely to be taken out if
volume is increasing, and more likely to appear to be a meaningful support
or resistance level if volume is decreasing.

YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY: YOUR BRAIN

Shortly after I began trading, I began to understand that I was often my
own biggest adversary. I took the standard path and began to read a lot
about psychology, which eventually led me to neuroeconomics—which
combines psychology, economics, and neuroscience—to discover how we
make choices. This study helped me better understand how humans learn
and evaluate, and how the chemistry of the brain affects our decision-
making process. It is well beyond the scope of this book to provide real
depth to these subjects. However, we will suggest that your success in the
markets can be highly dependent on your understanding of how your brain
processes information; the more you comprehend the brain’s workings, the

more you’ll be able to understand the true nature of your trading decisions.
You might also come to learn when it might be necessary to rewire your
brain to get past unproductive tendencies. We bring this up here because
we suspect that distinguishing between price and value may be extremely
difﬁcult for some, requiring not only learning something new, but also un-
learning modes of thinking that have become second nature.

In Mozart’s Brain and the Fighter Pilot: Unleashing Your Brain’s Po-
tential (New York: Harmony Books, 2001), a book we highly recommend,
Richard Restak, M.D. writes, “[C]ognition refers to the ability of the brain to
attend, identify, and act.” He includes among the components of cognition:
perceptual speed, learning, memory, problem solving, and creativity—all
of which, in our opinion, are utterly necessary to successful investing/
trading.

We have discussed the importance of maintaining a balanced perspec-
tive, and how monitoring market proﬁle structure helps maintain that per-
spective, especially when viewing both daily and multiday proﬁles. “Ex-
perts are not only better at putting things into perspective,” Dr. Restak
points out, “but quicker at detecting when they are starting to lose the
big picture.” We have talked a lot about timeframes that coexist, occasion-
ally merging together and causing large, nonlinear moves. I have been well
served by continually making sure that I can mentally keep the timeframes
separate; signiﬁcant losses are often a result of allowing the timeframes to
blur together—losing the big picture.

When I ﬁrst heard the phrase cognitive dissonance, a condition of con-
ﬂict or anxiety that results from inconsistency between one’s beliefs and
one’s actions, I paid it little heed. I considered it nothing but a psycholog-
ical term that clearly didn’t apply to me. However, following several peri-
ods of extremely shaky trading, I realized that several of the trades that
had caused me the most harm clearly went against my analysis. I had seen
the opportunity correctly and my timing had been good, but when the time
came to act, I couldn’t pull the trigger. On more than one occasion, I did
pull the trigger, but in direct opposition to what my research was telling
me to do. Delving into behavioral science literature and neuroeconomics
helped me greatly reduce the negative effects of cognitive dissonance.

For example, once I began to understand what neuronal networks are
and how they’re formed, I made several trading breakthroughs. Neuronal
networks begin to form as the brain encodes our repeated experiences.
This occurs as the result of practice over time. As I correctly viewed and
acted on market-generated information, it became better encoded in my
brain and assisted me in overcoming cognitive dissonance. “Over several
games,” to quote Dr. Restak again, “but not necessarily in a single game,
these networks will prove superior to the trial-and-error approach of the
novice.”

Some may take issue with referring to investing and trading as a game.
However, we agree with the idea of game as deﬁned by Sid Meir, designer
of the classic “Civilization” computer games, that is, “a series of mean-
ingful choices.” Meir’s deﬁnition also helped me develop a better under-
standing of how stress impacts performance. Today, because I’ve learned
to handle stress (only occasionally do I now swear at the computer screen),
it’s difﬁcult for someone in the same room with me to know if I’m “doing
well” or not. The point I’m trying to make is that learning must begin with
understanding—to play any game, you have to understand the game. To be
successful, you have to become a lifelong student of the game, immersed
in the markets with an open mind and an inquisitive spirit. Of course, you
can also choose to be a spectator, someone who knows a lot of interesting
facts, able to recite all kinds of impressive statistics. But the fact remains:
spectators can’t play the game.

SEEKING THE “EXCEPTIONALLY
TASTY PATTERNS”

Many of the really good trades require that you place your trade respon-
sively, fading the most recent move—which makes you a contrarian. As a
contrarian, you are no longer part of the crowd. You may have to stand
alone, occasionally incurring the doubt or even rancor of your friends
and associates. By reading extensively about the brain and the way our
decision-making process works, I have managed to increase my conﬁdence
to a level that enables me to place trades with less stress and cognitive
dissonance, particularly those trades that fade the most recent market di-
rection. Self-control is mandatory when markets begin to run hard; in the
past, when I wasn’t operating from a place of calm self-control, I would
have trouble accepting the fact that I had missed a big move, sometimes
getting in late with poor trade location and excessive risk.

Let’s look at some real examples of market structure that provided
excellent trading opportunities, as well as the emotional complexities each
engenders. First, we’ll examine the development of countertrend auctions.
Prior to the start of the countertrend rally, just one full-size S&P 500
futures contract had declined $21,000 (see boxed area in Figure 7.5). If you
have never traded, it will be difﬁcult to relate to the emotions that this
kind of volatility inspires. Even experienced traders will suffer the pulse-
pounding effects of an adrenaline surge when the market travels that kind
of distance in such a short period of time, making it increasingly difﬁcult
to maintain emotional control and objectivity. Understanding this natural
human reaction, I seldom trade the ﬁrst countertrend auction following a
signiﬁcant directional move. The emotional G-forces are just too intense.

FIGURE 7.5 Countertrend rally occurring in the S&P 500 (after the nonlinear
break): Daily bar chart, June 2006.

Figure 7.6 serves several purposes. First, it offers a review of the up-
side breakout that began in November of 2005 and ended in May 2006. (This
is the same period shown in Chapter 6, which enables us to maintain the-
matic continuity.) Second, it allows us to more easily visualize market be-
havior during the upward auction from November 2005 through May 2006
so that we can better understand how this behavior reverses once it be-
comes clear that the intermediate-term auction has changed course, turn-
ing down. Third, it reveals the ﬁrst meaningful low that occurred after the
nonlinear, downward auction.

The low on May 24 marks the beginning of the ﬁrst countertrend (up-
ward) auction. After the excess low is established, it is difﬁcult to know
how long the countertrend auction will last. In this example, however, it is
safe to assume that the ﬁrst countertrend auction will not carry very far,
as the market has just plummeted so sharply that it will most likely take
some time for it to come into balance, giving everyone time to catch their
breath. I prefer to wait and study the ﬁrst countertrend auction, extracting
as much information from it as possible. If this turns out to be a longer-
term low, there will be plenty of good trades down the road. Now let’s take
a more detailed look at the countertrend auction via the market proﬁle.

From the November 2005 upside breakout until the May 2006 high,
buying every break eventually rewarded traders with higher prices.
Traders—like everyone—have a habit of doing something until it doesn’t
work anymore. It would follow that once it became clear that the
intermediate-term trend had turned down, the expected trader behavior
would be to switch to the opposite strategy, selling rallies and repurchas-
ing on breaks. Figure 7.6 shows the ﬁrst meaningful low, following the May
11 nonlinear break, occurring on May 24—the low that marks the beginning
of the ﬁrst countertrend auction. Let’s put the countertrend auction under
a microscope by examining the auctions through the market proﬁle.

The low occurred in J period, and the market closed clear back up in
the top quarter of the proﬁle. On the following day, the market established
clearly higher price and value. (We are always more interested in value
than price.) The solid line to the right of each proﬁle marks the day’s value
area. Notice that Day 2 is fairly elongated, which tells us that prices were
auctioning higher with ease. Volume was approximately 1.6 billion, which,
from our earlier guidelines (1.6 through 2 billion being the normal range)
is light. The light volume should alert you to the fact that the upward auc-
tion attempt is weak. However, individual indicators must always be con-
sidered within the larger context—the market closed on the high and the
day’s proﬁle was elongated, which means that the odds would suggest that
the rally is not complete. As an investor or trader, you should continually
collect and process information as each auction unfolds before you. It is

chapter07

quite common to observe that some of the information you collect contra-
dicts other information, a phenomenon that is often caused by different
timeframes responding to different criteria. Remember, it is common to
have an intermediate-term auction going one way, and either a shorter- or
longer-term auction going another direction. Notice in Figure 7.7, on Day
3 of the rally, how the proﬁle becomes squat (from high to low) and wide
(from left to right), which suggests that the countertrend rally is ending, or
has ended. In addition, the day had light volume—another indication that
the rally is coming to an end. This was a three-day, short-term trade that
should have been exited on Day 3. Light volume provided an early warning
on Day 2, and the shape of the proﬁle and another light-volume report on
Day 3 indicated that the odds of continuation were low. Counter-auctions,
which by deﬁnition are against the trend, generally require quicker exits.

Before and after you place a trade, the most important question to ask
is this: How much conﬁdence is the market exhibiting to support your
trading decision? Some of the factors to monitor in order to better under-
stand the market’s conﬁdence are:

Ĺ Attempted direction—which way was the market attempting to go?
Ĺ Volume associated with the directional move.
Ĺ Value area placement—overlapping-to-higher, higher, unchanged,

overlapping-to-lower, or lower.

Ĺ Shape—was the proﬁle elongated, symmetrical, or squat?

As we have said, the market proﬁle enables you to see the structure
of unfolding market activity. And over time, your experience will enable
you to recognize partial patterns that enable you to visualize how the day’s
auctions might unfold. We are always seeking to identify trades that enable
an advantageous risk-reward relationship. It is impossible for the human
brain to accurately digest, comprehend, and analyze the dense thicket of
information that inﬂuences the market from moment to moment. But the
brain has evolved to be remarkably adept at recognizing patterns, and the
market proﬁle captures the complex and everchanging interconnections
present in the market in patterns that can be recognized and understood in
an intuitive way.

Ralph Koster, author of A Theory of Fun for Game Design (Scotts-
dale, AZ: Paraglyph, 2004) wrote: “Based on my reading, the human brain
is mostly a voracious consumer of patterns, a soft pudgy gray Pac-Man
of concepts. Games are just exceptionally tasty patterns to eat up.” We
also believe that one of the problems with patterns is that our minds are
also inclined to ﬁnd patterns that don’t exist. We seek patterns that sup-
port our beliefs—it’s just human nature. From an investing standpoint, this

chapter07

MARKETS IN PROFILE

tendency becomes nearly inescapable if you also listen to the hype on tele-
vision and in “expert” newsletters; before too long, the brain begins to ac-
tively hide the truth from you.

Koster’s enlightening book is about games and game design. The fact
is, trading is a game in which there are winners and losers, and score is kept
in dollars and cents and those all-important track records that can make or
break a money manager (not to mention a personal fortune). That’s why
we keep reiterating the salient factors—like proﬁle shape, value area, and
volume distribution—that enable us to objectively see what the market is
really telling us.

ALL PRICES AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE
NOT EQUAL

The shorter the timeframe you’re trading, the more important the timely
placement of your trade; every time you enter or exit a trade, you are, in
fact, a day trader. By necessity, day timeframe information will be included
in the analysis of Figure 7.8, but note that the day timeframe will be more
fully explicated in Chapter 8.

In Figure 7.8, the ﬁrst three days, reading from left to right, are the
same three days that made up the short-term, countertrend auction dis-
cussed previously in Figure 7.7. Having seen the initial countertrend rally
weaken substantially, we would look to trade from the short side as we
come into Day 4. The selling tail—the single set of downward prints in the
opening B period—demonstrates a high-conﬁdence opening; longer-term
sellers are aggressively selling from the opening bell. Not only are they sell-
ing early, but notice that the selling started well below the previous day’s
close, a clear indication that the prevailing market sentiment is that prices
are too high.

With this clear indication of directional conviction, we ask that you
consider the proﬁle indicators that provide clues about the collective will
of the market. The previous day’s close was near the high for the day, which
probably gave traders comfort in taking home long positions, thinking that
they could get out in the morning if necessary. When the market opened
quite a bit lower, however, consider how badly they must have wanted to
sell, if they were willing to sell well below the previous day’s close, con-
tinuing to sell at even lower prices all through the opening B period. Like
any game, it is important to continually attempt to ﬁgure out what your
opponents are thinking and doing, and if they are right—with the larger
market movement—or are getting themselves into trouble, which means
they’ll have to reverse their positions in the near future.

On Day 4 in Figure 7.8, the aggressiveness exhibited in the opening B
period should—if the sellers are correct—lead to lower value, an elongated
proﬁle, and high volume. Having this as a foundation for your analysis, you
now have some parameters with which to monitor the day; your goal is to
free yourself from relying solely on the advertising mechanism of price to

monitor the market’s intentions. Notice that the day’s proﬁle shape follow-
ing the B period sell off starts to resemble the letter b prior to the mar-
ket making a late-in-the-day sell-off, demonstrated by the M period selling
price spike (in the rectangular box). The b-shaped pattern is one that you
will see often, and it represents two things: (1) Sellers are primarily liqui-
dating long positions (the opposite of a short-covering rally), rather than
a combination of long liquidation and new shorting; and (2) buyers are at
least slightly more patient than sellers. This is important to note because
these patient buyers are not in it for a “day trade,” but rather some longer
timeframe—at least overnight. Unlike the day-timeframe trader, these buy-
ers are more patient and may, in fact, be scaling into large positions. You
may not see the effects of this type of buying for a few days. Recall that we
noted earlier that successful trading requires that you piece together long
strings of data, and that you retain your ability to objectively recall that
data within the context of constantly evolving market conditions. Not an
easy task.

All rallies, at least initially, include a combination of short covering
and new buying. For the rally to be sustained, however, new buying must
overtake short covering. When this occurs, the proﬁle becomes elongated.
When it doesn’t, and short covering rules the day, a lack of continued new
buying often results in a proﬁle shape that resembles the letter p. The mir-
ror image occurs on market breaks, which start out with longs liquidating
existing positions, accompanied by the formation of new shorts. When new
shorting is consistent, the market proﬁle becomes elongated, while lack of
new shorting often results in a proﬁle shape that resembles the letter b.

Our position, over the years, has consistently been that markets are
not efﬁcient. If that is correct, then what has occurred in the past does, in
fact, affect the odds of future activity. If the markets were efﬁcient, and
all prices and opportunities were equal, the past would have no bearing
on later outcomes. Back to Day 4 in Figure 7.8. The b formation serves
as an alert that the odds of the market going lower have decreased—but
have not gone away. Late in the day the market spikes lower, which should
cause you to question the conclusions we’ve drawn up to this point. Recall,
however, that the buying we saw in the center portion of the market proﬁle
may have been for a longer timeframe. The price spike on Day 4 may also
have been the “completion” of what started early in the morning—traders
selling what they perceive to be price above value. The question posed by
a price spike is this: will value be pulled down to price, or will price revert
back to volume? If the spike was on low volume, then the odds favor price
reverting back to the mean, which would be the value area from the day the
spike occurred; if the spike was on heavy volume, then you would expect
value to be lower on the following day as the mean (value) moves toward
new price levels.

The spike on Day 4 occurred on low volume, as did the whole day.
I would have entered this trade—which was with the longer-term trend
down—looking for conviction to the down side. Because of the b shape

of the proﬁle that day, indicating no real seller conviction, the evidence
supported closing out such a trade. It takes a great deal of mental discipline
to exit a proﬁtable trade that you had been looking for, especially when it
is with the trend on a day that closes near the low. But there is a huge
difference between closing out a trade and reversing your position. Again,
it is important to get inside the head of your opponents. What would most
market participants feel about the same trade? Probably that is was a good
trade and that the market was weak (because they were focusing on price),
so it is unlikely that the market will turn quickly.

Anyone can tell you what the market did. But consider looking at
things another way—what didn’t happen? In this last example, the mar-
ket proﬁle was not elongated; the shape didn’t indicate that trade was be-
ing facilitated on the down side, and volume didn’t validate lower price
and value. Because the market was struggling to go lower, the natural
reaction is to begin to think about the upside. Remember, the market is
a series of two-way auctions, which are the market’s means of gaining
information—whether we’re discussing the day timeframe or any of the
longer timeframes, the two-way auction process is ongoing.

ONGOING FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

Turning our attention to Figure 7.9, let’s ﬁrst remember that we had con-
cluded that it would be wise to close out any short positions—despite the
fact that price closed near the low of the selling price spike (rectangular
box on Day 4), which would tend to make anyone who took home a short
feel pretty good. But because of lower volume and the b formation (circled
area), the trade should have been exited.

On Day 5,

the market opened higher, closed higher, showed
overlapping-to-lower value, and never seriously challenged the excess low
created by the late spike on Day 4. When a spike occurs, you can’t de-
termine if it was, in fact, an excess low until the following day when the
market opens; there’s simply not enough nighttime volume to enable this
determination to be reliably made. Earlier, we talked about the perils of
conﬂicting information, which was evident on this day. Experienced Mar-
ket Proﬁle users would question going home with a long position on Day
5, as value was overlapping-to-lower. The more important piece of infor-
mation, however, was that the excess created by the spike on Day 5 was
not seriously challenged, as well as the fact that a late rebound closed
the market near the daily high. To remain with a long position, I would
have needed to see continuation very early on Day 6. The Day 5 range was
completely contained within the range of Day 4, which is referred to as an

chapter07

inside day, or as a neutral or balancing day. For short timeframe traders,
we recommend that you trade with any directional auction following a
neutral/balancing day; when markets come out of balance, there is al-
ways at least a short-term opportunity to take advantage of the ensuing
auction.

The following day (Day 6) was a trend day, which is essentially a day in
which the market moves almost continually in a single direction for most
of the day. The biggest mistake a short-term trader can make is to refuse
to believe a trend day. If you don’t want to go with it—that is, trade in the
same direction as the trend—then at least don’t go against it. The trend day
provided early conﬁrmation of our analysis from Day 5. Despite the day
timeframe trend day up, the market proﬁle on Day 6 developed a shape
that resembles the letter p (“early warning” arrow), which means buying
was being met by longer-term sellers, or at least by those who were will-
ing to hold a short position overnight or for a few days. On this day, there
was an upward price spike late in the day (the single letter M through the
letter N on the high). The p formation—just like its mirror image, the b
formation—provides an early warning that the market is struggling to auc-
tion higher. It will take some experience to recognize these formations, and
the last two examples we discussed were somewhat camouﬂaged by late
spikes, which are often the completion of an auction when they follow the
b and p patterns.

On Day 7, value was, in fact, established higher. Notice on this day that
the low was made in F period and then matched in G period; if there had
been aggressive responsive buyers—those looking for an opportunity as
prices sold off—then price would have probably only traded at that level
during a single time period. The fact that the market traded on the low dur-
ing two different time periods suggests that that particular price was not
considered to be such a scarce opportunity by longer timeframe buyers,
meaning also that it was probably not a very good low (and would be revis-
ited). Some might say that this is just nuance. It is. But details matter, and
successful short- and intermediate-term traders tuck away these details as
part of their ongoing forensic investigation of the developing shape of each
day’s market proﬁle.

Day 7 is another balancing day (observe how the day is almost com-
pletely symmetrical, a sign of balance), and the same rules discussed ear-
lier apply here as well—trade with the initial auction away from balance.
Remember also that everything must be viewed within its proper context,
and in this case the long-term auction remains down, which means that
a trade with a break-out to the downside coming out of this inside day is
more likely to be signiﬁcant than one to the upside.

On Day 8 the market broke from balance, auctioning briskly to the
downside and creating a trend day capped by a long selling price spike.
Take a moment to compare Day 8 to Day 6—both were created by

chapter07

breakouts from balance, but Day 8 was with the longer-term down auction,
while Day 7 was against it. The breakout with the longer-term auction was
clearly the more signiﬁcant of the two.

With this breakout from balance into a selling trend day, we can clearly
state that Day 7 marked the high for the market’s second countertrend
auction following the nonlinear break. Next, we will examine the auc-
tions that followed Day 8, a trend day in the same direction as the ma-
jor auction that erupted out of a balancing day that had established the
high of the second counter-auction. Before we do, however, let’s review
Figure 7.10, which will help us better understand the two countertrend
auctions.

MARKETS IN PROFILE

In the course of examining each day of the two countertrend auc-
tions discussed previously, we have attempted to identify viable short-term
trades. With each auction we have learned something new about the shift-
ing responses of the market’s participants. For eight days we saw only lim-
ited continuation of short-term auctions in both directions, which is con-
sistent with a market attempting to come into balance, to catch its breath
after a strong, nonlinear move. Before we push on, take a moment to reﬂect
back on the signiﬁcance of spikes and trend days, and in particular the sig-
niﬁcance of trend days that don’t result in uniformly elongated shape, such
as Day 4 in Figure 7.9—a trend day down that resulted in the b formation,
which did not bode well for continuation. Similarly, Day 6 was a trend day
up that resulted in a p formation. When spikes occur, you should observe
whether price reverts back to value, or value is pulled to price. Finally, Day
8 was a trend day in the direction of the intermediate-term auction.

Now let’s review the days that followed, ﬁrst reviewing them via a daily

bar, and then via daily market proﬁles.

LOOKING FOR THE ALL-IMPORTANT
REFERENCE POINTS

Markets by their very nature often provide easily identiﬁable reference
points that can assist in identifying advantageous trade location. In
Figure 7.11, for example, you can see a gap that was left at 1,303.50 during
the initial nonlinear break. The second countertrend rally (that we just dis-
cussed) failed to ﬁll that gap by .50, or half of a point. These are the “tells”
that become extremely important to successful short-term and day traders,
and they can be best viewed when using futures pit session bar charts, as
opposed to cash or electronic futures. While the volume in the futures pit
sessions is low relative to daytime electronic trading, I have found that it is
more reliable in identifying subtle clues to market intention. The electronic
market tends to trade a tic or two both higher and lower than the pit ses-
sion, which is often on miniscule volume. For example, the gap at 1,303.50
occurred during the pit sessions, and would not have been evident if you
were using the electronic contract.

In fact, it’s often possible to ﬁnd compound evidence to help identify
asymmetric trading opportunities. In addition to the gap that wasn’t ﬁlled,
you can also observe a reference point in the solid line drawn just beneath
the gap that separates the multi-week, upper trading range. This is the
line beneath which the market accelerated once price found acceptance,
spurring the ﬁrst nonlinear break. As we have said, the auction continually
searches for new activity as part of the information-discovery process. This

phenomenon is clearly manifest in the second countertrend auction, which
peeked up above the solid line into the previous balancing range, where it
quickly discovered that higher prices were cutting off activity and attract-
ing sellers; because the intermediate-term auction is down, in this instance,
this is the expected behavior. Of the three pieces of information that iden-
tiﬁed the ideal place for a short-term trade, two were tangible (gap and
prior trading range low) and the third, the expected behavior, was more
psychological.

Once the downward auction got underway, it continued for eight days.
Referring to the arrow marked “early warning” and the arrow pointing to
the original low, you will notice how price traded below the original low
and then traded back above that reference point for the next two days.
Earlier in in this book, we discussed the idea of “clean breaks,” which is

chapter07

MARKETS IN PROFILE

applicable in this example. The point marked “original low” had managed
to contain price on the downside for 15 days after the market broke below
the upper trading range and upper gap. After this low was taken out, price
quickly returned to the 15-day range for a day and a half before resuming its
downside exploration. The “early warning” noted in Figure 7.11 is there be-
cause the break was not “clean”—in other words, once price broke through
the original low, it didn’t immediately continue downward. This provides
an early warning that the downside auction is starting to exhaust itself. As
you can observe, a few days later the market made a low and gapped higher
the following day, quickly returning to the previous 15-day trading range.

Before we review these same days via the market proﬁle, let’s con-
sider the heightened emotional state that most traders and investors must
often endure. (If you’ve never traded, hopefully this will provide a glimpse
into the mental complexities that must be managed in order to trade suc-
cessfully; for those who have traded, this may simply add realism to the
discourse.) When you see a market analyzed after the fact, like we’ve just
done, it’s hard to understand just what it is that’s so difﬁcult about trad-
ing. Performing this kind of analysis under stress is incredibly challenging,
and not just because money is on the line. For several years prior to the
nonlinear break we’ve been discussing, average volatility remained well
below its historic average, and individual trader and trading-system strate-
gies operated within a relatively low-volatility environment. Then came the
break and volatility rose rapidly. This kind of quick transition is hard to ad-
just to, both mentally and emotionally. During times of stress and sudden
transition, the mind has a tendency to become disoriented, often choos-
ing to focus on worst-case scenarios rather than the bigger picture. After
the break, of course the news shows rolled out the “bears,” continually fo-
cusing on the declining markets, how bad things were, and how bad they
could get.

Almost all of the experienced traders I talked to during this period
were similarly infected with the prevailing sentiment of doom and gloom.
No matter how well trained you are, no matter how experienced and conﬁ-
dent and calm, it’s truly difﬁcult to be objective when everyone around you
has lost their grip on objectivity, and price volatility is exhibiting nothing
but wide, volatile swings. When the market starts to whipsaw, it’s almost
impossible to catch your breath. Now the proﬁle in Figure 7.12.

As shown in Figure 7.12, Day 8 was a trend day down, ﬁnishing with
a late price spike. During the next two days the market balanced from the
center of the Day 8 spike downward. This tells us that value was being
pulled lower to price, which is a good sign of downward auction contin-
uation. Day 10 also saw a late spike with price probing lower, once again
raising the question, will price be pulled back to value or will value migrate

to conﬁrm the lower price probe. As always, we focus on value, not price.
On Day 11, a value trader saw clearly lower value, while a price trader saw
unchanged price. Day 12 exhibited overlapping-to-higher value and lower
price. Day 12 was also a balancing day, which positions us for a new direc-
tional trade once the market leaves that balance range.

However, there is clearly conﬂicting information due to the fact that
Day 12 resulted in overlapping-to-higher value, while both Days 11 and 12
remained below the average balance of Days 9 and 10, which alerts us to
the fact that the intermediate-term auction down may be tiring—but isn’t
necessarily over. This lets us know that the risk of remaining short has
grown substantially; successful trading/investing is based on identifying
advantageous probability.

Day 13 was another trend day down with a late downward spike. Fol-
lowing this activity, we again observed to see if value was pulled lower
on Day 14, which is exactly what happened. In Figure 7.13, notice the ar-
row labeled “early warning” in the upper portion of the Day 13 proﬁle. The
nonelongated proﬁle shape provided another alert that the auction was tir-
ing. During this day, the news reports were growing more pessimistic as
price continued lower, and those with short positions were probably feel-
ing more and more comfortable.

Day 14 provided clearly lower price and value; however, notice another
“early warning” arrow—the fat shape of the proﬁle suggests that lower
prices are not engendering continuation to the down side. Our evidence
shows that while prices are steadily migrating downward, the market is
struggling to move lower, laboring step by step without the freewheeling
conviction that accompanies sustainable directional movement. But think
about how this feels in the moment. When you look only at price, the mar-
ket is clearly moving lower. How in the world could you buy? This is an
opportune place to reintroduce Gladwell’s diffusion model. At this stage
in the auction, it is the late majority and the laggards who are dragging
price downward because they focus only on price and because they’re
scared—what if I’m missing out on the next major trend?

On this day, if you could have measured the collective emotions of
all market participants, you would have found a predominance of fear in
those who were long, and a great deal of conﬁdence in those who were
short. But if you considered the balance of market-generated information
that we’ve been discussing, you’d have found evidence that just the op-
posite was true. During this frenzy of market volatility, if you were able
to acknowledge your emotions as a product of herd mentality and news
hype, instead focusing your empirical mind on the patterns being revealed
in market structure—revealed by organizing purely market-generated in-
formation via the market proﬁle—you would have seen that the market
was struggling mightily on the downside.

NEVER BE A LAGGARD

We have spent a good deal of time discussing the notion of timeframes
and conﬂicting information. Trading is extremely difﬁcult when you aren’t

chapter07

MARKETS IN PROFILE

able to separate the actions of the various timeframes; oftentimes, what
appears to be “conﬂicting” information is simply information coming from
timeframes with different motives conducting business on the same day.
Days 14 and 15, for example, offer excellent day-timeframe opportunities
and poor intermediate-term opportunities. For the ﬁve days prior, evidence
accumulated that suggested intermediate-term shorts were late in the auc-
tion process, and any new shorts placed during these days had poor trade
location. Auctions generally have to complete themselves, which leads to
the situation we discussed earlier when the odds are high that the market
must continue in the direction of current auction, but that the risk/reward
relationship inherent in trading with that direction is extremely poor.

On Day 16, all the conﬂicting, compounding information ﬁnally over-
whelmed the market, which gapped higher and nearly took back the previ-
ous ﬁve days in one elongated trend day. Returning to Kuhn’s description of
major transitions, such shifts occur when new circumstances violate what
has been considered “normal” by all those invested in what was previously
considered status quo—in this case, the downward auction. On Day 16, the
transition was universally recognized as the market shot upward, leaving
the late majority and the laggards holding the bag.

When I’m analyzing any auction for any timeframe, the key issue I fo-
cus on is this: What are my competitors doing? For example, as the kind
of conﬂicting evidence discussed above begins to mount, I try to discern
how much money is getting short at disadvantageous levels, often referred
to as “getting short in the hole.” Experience has taught me that that those
who get in late are the ﬁrst to exit—as in accounting, last in ﬁrst out. This is
weak money and unlikely to have staying power. The nonsymmetric shapes
that we have been labeling “early warnings” not only tell us that the mar-
ket is struggling as it goes lower, but should also cause us to ask “Why is
it struggling?” The answer is often because there are patient, longer-term
buyers who are gradually but steadily accumulating inventory—inventory
that they’re willing to hold for a long time. It’s not uncommon, particularly
in intermediate-term auctions, to see this process occurring over several
days before it becomes unmistakably evident to a broader participant base
(the late majority and laggards). These are the conditions that lead to re-
versals, or at least meaningful corrections.

A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

We’ve made a pretty strong case that a healthy trending market trends,
then stops and balances, then trends again. But it doesn’t always hap-
pen this way, particularly when speculation takes over like it did in gold

during the ﬁrst half of 2006. Due to extreme speculation, the market ne-
glected to stop and balance along the way; when such speculative trades
are unwound, a freefall can result. Let’s examine the relatively rare in-
stances in which trades can start out as short-term positions and then
evolve into much bigger opportunities.

At Point 1 in Figure 7.14, gold topped out in much the same way the
S&Ps did back in May 2006—gold made a new life-of-contract high on sub-
standard volume. The arrow at the bottom of Figure 7.14 points to volume
on the day that we’re discussing. As you can see, the volume was well be-
low the range that high-volume days can generate in this precious metal.

Notice that gold rose from about $580 an ounce to about $750 without
a prolonged balancing period. This is usually a sign of extreme specula-
tion, which can end badly for those who arrive late, or those who get in
early but continue to build on their positions, and for momentum players.
Balancing periods are healthy and important, in that they allow the market
participants to “catch their breath” and reevaluate value before proceeding
onward. Balancing periods enable you to judge the structure of the mar-
ket in order to determine how much more momentum is remaining in the

dominant auction. Periods of balance create what are akin to “market
memory.” Once a market begins to fall (or rise in the converse), previous
balance areas will often provide some level of support (or resistance), serv-
ing to slow price down as market participants assess whether this area of
previously accepted value is still relevant.

Without this balancing process, there is no structure to support a mar-
ket. Once a market begins to fall, for example, the balance areas act like
elevator stops—they may not completely stop the fall, but they will usually
provide a pause in the downward auction that offers enough time for you
to exit a trade, or at least judge where you are in the larger decline.

Returning to Figure 7.14, anyone who was monitoring the volume dur-
ing the ﬁnal run-up in gold at Point 1 and placed a short-term short, quickly
discovered that all timeframes had joined in the selling. With no structure
to provide support to a downside break, what might have begun as a short-
term trade can blossom into a meaningful, long-term trade. For those who
insist on buying into markets with no underlying structural support, we
suggest you do it with options rather than outrights.

FADE THE EXTREMES, GO WITH BREAKOUTS

Good short-term trades often present themselves when a market has come
into balance. Such markets usually provide two opportunities: fading an
auction that reaches one of its bracket extremes and fails to continue; and
going with a breakout from the balance area. Figure 7.15 demonstrates
both of these possibilities.

Day 1 of Figure 7.15 is a trend day that has moved sharply higher. You
could reasonably expect that a move of this magnitude should show some
additional upward price appreciation. You can also assume that much of
the buying that drove the stock higher during the initial trend day occurred
late in the day, as that is where the market proﬁle begins to take shape (the
circled area); the lower portion of the proﬁle is thin, which indicates price
was moving rapidly without much time for volume to attach to it.

Day 2 established a very narrow value area that was totally contained
within the upper portion of the value area from Day 1. At this point, you
should be thinking about the mindset of the buyers from Days 1 and 2—are
they satisﬁed? Are they frustrated? Know your competitors, and stay one
step ahead of the game.

Day 3 opened slightly above the close on Day 2, trending higher all day
and closing with a late upward spike. When the day was complete, value
only managed to be overlapping-to-higher, and the shape, prior to the late
spike, exhibited the familiar p shape of short covering; it’s clear that MER

The combined proﬁle shows the cumulative p pattern that we have con-
stantly discussed when viewing individual proﬁles—short covering met by
new sellers who are selling for a longer timeframe. As you gain experience,
you will begin to visualize different patterns long before they’re complete,
which will make you feel more comfortable leaning into the wind, placing
short-term trades before they are actually under way, which will help you
secure advantageous trade location.

In Figure 7.17 (see page 135) (a repeat of Figure 7.15), we see that after
four days, more and more market participants have begun to recognize
that the upward auction is over; nearly all long positions placed during
the previous four days are now under water. Put yourself in their shoes,
imagine the stress level climbing. Short-term trading is a game, and they
are your opposition.

Notice the notation in Figure 7.17 that suggests you compare the trend
day up that started the last rally with the trend day down that reversed that
rally. The trend day that started the rally lost its elongation near the upper
end of the range, and during the following three days there was very little
follow through. The trend day down stayed elongated through the closing
bell, which suggests downside continuation. This trade should have been
taken home short, and any long positions established during the previous
several days should have been exited. While it can be psychologically dif-
ﬁcult to take this loss if you’re still long, the exit may be one of the best
trades you make. Figure 7.18 (see page 136) shows the resulting downside
continuation—Day 5 exhibits an elongated proﬁle that tells us that price
did not go low enough to cut off the selling.

This type of analysis is what trading is all about, and unless you are
fully immersed in the markets, you will simply never learn to assess and
amalgamate the many elements—both tangible and intangible—that enable
you to place a trade that ameliorates risk without compromising potential
reward.

“THE EXPERT REASONS CONTEXTUALLY”

In his book Enhancing Trader Performance: Proven Strategies From
the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &
Sons, 2006)—which should be read and reread by all serious market
participants—Brett Steenbarger states:

Where the novice thinks concretely, the expert rea-
sons contextually. Instead of thinking A always
leads to B, the expert creates a web of possibilities
in which A leads to B under conditions X and Y,
but leads to C under other conditions.

In other words, the expert is able to stay ﬂexible, avoiding the nat-
ural human tendency to make choices based on available surface infor-
mation, then to defend that choice come hell or high water—regardless
of whether “other conditions” have arisen that invalidate all previous
beliefs.

We all face a continuous ﬂow of conﬂicting information, and it’s easy
to overweight the latest piece of information, or to choose just one of those
pieces of information as the basis of a trade decision. History reveals that
people aren’t very good at reaching accurate conclusions when enormously
complex information must be analyzed and weighted correctly. We may be
good at looking at each piece of information separately, but when it comes
to relating each piece to the larger, cohesive whole—well, let’s just say
context is an elusive thing. Consider just a few of the myriad divergent in-
formation sources that can inﬂuence the performance of a market, sector,
or single security at any given moment:

Ĺ Corporate governance—both good and ill
Ĺ Shifting government regulations
Ĺ A company’s ability (or inability) to innovate
Ĺ Earnings—rising, falling, or remaining static
Ĺ PE multiples—expanding or contracting
Ĺ Sales—expanding or contracting
Ĺ Competitors—entering or exiting
Ĺ Proﬁt margins—expanding or contracting
Ĺ Overall sector growth and acceptance
Ĺ Global events
Ĺ Analyst upgrades or downgrades
Ĺ Money managers long or short on cash
Ĺ Redemptions vs. new cash entering
Ĺ Commodity prices—rising or falling
Ĺ Interest rates—rising or falling
Ĺ Trending vs. trading
Ĺ Tax selling
Ĺ Forced liquidation due to an external event
Ĺ Foreign market crises

And of course every element on this list can exist anywhere on the
scale of “relevant” to “immaterial,” depending on whether the market has
correctly anticipated the future implications of that element. The bottom
line: We are constantly bombarded with a mind-boggling amount of infor-
mation, and the brain has a habit of ﬁltering out everything except what is
most self-serving. This process may make us temporarily comfortable, but
when has comfort ever been associated with proﬁtability?

That’s where the market proﬁle proves to be an invaluable tool, keep-
ing us psychologically and intellectually honest. We may not be good at
crunching enormously complex data, but we humans are exceptionally
adept at spotting patterns and integrating them into workable solutions.
Economists claim that you can’t understand what markets do without tak-
ing into account how people perceive what they do, and that it’s virtually
impossible to accurately measure the complex patterns of human behavior.
We disagree—Market Proﬁle does exactly that by arranging the aggregate
result of all these complex actions in a single, simple distribution curve.

Day Trading Is
for Everyone

The man who insists upon seeing with perfect
clearness before he decides, never decides.

—Henri-Frederic Amiel

Much of the world seems to hold day traders in ill regard. As we

have pointed out on multiple occasions, however, everyone is a
day trader on the day they enter or exit a trade. Every tick, every

basis point of performance matters.

Consider this: Everyone who participates in a hedge fund, separately
managed account, pension fund, endowment, foundation, or mutual fund
is affected by day trading.

Here is a case in point. Over the years I’ve handled numerous calls from
traders with the same question about large institutional orders: “Should
I ﬁll it now, or do I have time to work the order over the remainder of
the day?” When you’re working large orders, the quality of the ﬁll affects
both the ﬁlling broker and the performance of the institution providing the
order ﬂow.

Recently, I read The Mighty and the Almighty: Reﬂections on Amer-
ica, God, and World Affairs (New York: HarperCollins, 2006) by Madeleine
Albright, a book that delivered one of the messages that we’ve been reiter-
ating throughout Markets in Proﬁle. In reﬂecting on her daily routine at the
State Department, Albright recounted how every morning she would read
the President’s Daily Brief, after which she would wade through the Na-
tional Intelligence Daily, which was the longer version of the Daily Brief.
This reading was followed by a brieﬁng on terrorist threats. After down-
loading all this intelligence, she reported one thing missing: “certainty.”

What also caught my attention was the following, “[U]nless you were very
careful, what you would see often depended more on what you expected
or hoped to see than on what was really there.”

It is often said that there is “too much noise” to successfully trade in
the day timeframe. During the early years of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, I’d occasionally have lunch with Fischer Black, who, along with
Myron Scholes, provided us with the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.
One of our most frequent topics of discussion was “noise.” My position,
which differed quite a bit from Fischer’s at the time, was that there was
no such thing. I felt that what people called noise was simply something
they didn’t yet understand. Peter Steidlmayer best dismissed the concept
of noise when he said that every trade occurs to satisfy some condition of
the market. This remains my belief today. For example, if a market rallies
quickly, and just as quickly retreats, it may well have done so because the
market got “too short” or, said another way, the market got out of whack
in the short-term and inventory had to be rebalanced. The mirror image oc-
curs when the market gets too long and we experience short-term liquida-
tion breaks that serve to correct long inventory imbalances. These rallies or
breaks occur for a reason. They satisfy the need to bring inventories back
into equilibrium. In this chapter, we demonstrate several techniques for as-
sessing such short-term inventory conditions. Armed with this understand-
ing, you are better equipped to effectively execute your day-timeframe or-
ders.

In Advances in Behavioral Finance (New York: Russell Sage Founda-
tion, 1993), edited by Richard Thaler, there is an article reprinted from the
Journal of Finance in which Fischer wrote:

Noise makes ﬁnancial markets possible, but also
makes them imperfect. If there is no noise trading,
there will be very little trading in individual as-
sets. People will hold individual assets, directly or
indirectly, but they will rarely trade them.

Imperfection creates opportunity as well as its converse: risk. We bring
up noise here because we believe it is vital for traders to accept responsibil-
ity for the outcome of every trade and every action, avoiding the tendency
to externally assign credit or blame. Let’s take the next step and discuss
the tactics of day trading.

WHAT’S A DAY TRADER TO DO?

Successful day trading hinges on understanding what your opponents are
doing; sometimes you’ll want to join them, and other times—especially
when either long- or short-term inventories are out of balance—you will

chapter08

want to step aside or even fade (go against) the imbalance. There will also
be times when the short-term inventory conditions aren’t corrected by the
market’s close and can be expected to effect the after-hours markets, pos-
sibly even carrying over into the following morning’s activity.

We begin by discussing the more accepted deﬁnition of day trading:
trades that begin and end on the same day—a buy and a sell, which can
occur in any order. Some complete only a limited number of trades in a
single day; others are far more proliﬁc. For a quick recap, let’s review the
deﬁnition of day traders from Chapter 3.

The day trader enters the market with no position and goes home the
same way. Day traders process news announcements, reﬂect on technical
analysis, and read order ﬂow in order to make trading decisions. They also
have to deal with long- and short-term program buying and selling, broker-
age ﬁrm margin calls, mortgage banker’s duration adjustments, speeches
by Federal Reserve governors, and “important pronouncements” by polit-
ical leaders and inﬂuential portfolio managers. Anyone who believes mar-
kets are rational should spend a day trying to digest and react to the land-
slide of conﬂicting data day traders must wade through to make a decision.
This group focuses on large quantities of technical information. They
love numbers and levels and hype. Like scalpers, day traders also provide
liquidity for markets, although very often at great personal expense.

The second, nonstandard deﬁnition of day trader is one that we have
referred to throughout the book: the one-sided buy or sell order placed by
other-timeframe participants, including individuals, hedge funds, mutual
funds, endowments, foundations, institutionally managed accounts, and so
on. In Chapter 7, for example, we discussed short-term trading and stated
that the beginning or end of all short-term trades are day trades. However,
not all day trades are the beginning or end of short-term trades.

There is endless philosophy surrounding the deﬁnition of day trad-
ing. Some tell you to study what has happened during previous days and
overnight markets; others advise you to do no homework, beginning each
day “fresh” with absolutely no opinions. Some suggest that you trade early,
as most activity occurs during the ﬁrst half of the day, and still others ad-
vise you not to trade until the market has been open for a couple hours,
and you have a better sense of the day’s developing structure. Let’s begin
with the homework debate.

The only group that can consistently proﬁt without doing homework is
the pure scalpers—those that execute many trades, often totaling in the
hundreds and involving thousands of shares or contracts, that are held
for very short periods of time, sometimes only seconds. These scalpers
are traders who have become extremely adept at reading market swings;
they’ve developed a purely reﬂective response to signiﬁcant changes in or-
der ﬂow. But the truly successful scalpers are few; most have a checkered

chapter08

MARKETS IN PROFILE

history in that they’ve done well in certain types of markets, only to give
it all back when conditions change. For example, scalping a low-volatility
market is quite different than scalping a high-volatility market. And scalp-
ing has become much more competitive due to computer programs that
execute via electronic trading and can instantaneously respond to bids
and offers.

In a trending market—whether it is a long- or intermediate-term
trend—I do a lot of homework (as discussed in Chapter 7) so I can be-
gin the trading day with two or three possible scenarios worked out.
This homework consists of analyzing the previous day’s volume and
identifying past areas of excess (including gaps), beginning with the latest
day and working backward. Next, I identify past balance ranges, beginning
with shortest time period—the shortest would be an inside day or symmet-
rical balancing day—and working toward the longest timeframe. (Note that
this process is the inverse of what I do for longer term trade identiﬁcation.)
As already discussed, too much detail can blur your focus on longer-term
trading, causing you to overreact to short-term information—which is fuel
for day traders. I also place a high priority on identifying prominent points
of control (POC) from previous trading sessions. To reiterate, the POC is
the longest horizontal line in a day’s proﬁle. A “prominent” POC is unusu-
ally wide, and tends to create a gravitational center that prevents the day
from becoming elongated. Prominent POCs are often revisited, and may
provide guidance for placing or exiting the following day’s trade. Why? Be-
cause they represent a recent area of a widely accepted fair price.

In nontrending markets or markets that are exhibiting a great deal of
volatility, I begin with the same analysis described above and then dive
into more granular detail by adding short-term references points, such as
the previous daily highs and lows, weekly highs and lows, trend lines (not
that I necessarily believe in them; however, if markets are trading without
direction, traditional technical reference points provide some guidance),
and a look at other markets that may affect short-term trading. When mar-
kets lack direction or conviction—are nontrending—peripheral inﬂuences
are far more important. For example, if stocks are in a strong trend, in-
terest rate changes may not have any meaningful short-term effect, while
in a nontrending environment interest rate changes may greatly inﬂuence
market activity.

While I prefer to trade early, there is nothing wrong with waiting for
the day to develop. Having said that, I believe you should act as if you were
trading the entire day—otherwise you may miss some of the important de-
tails that provide harbingers of the structure you’re waiting for. In general,
I believe that beginning traders would beneﬁt from witnessing the day’s
structure become more manifest before trading, while experienced traders
should be able to gain an advantage from trading early in the day.

I have always maintained that it is unwise for day traders to trade
in front of early economic releases; there are simply too many oppor-
tunities for chaos that result in unreadable market conditions. If the re-
lease has been correctly anticipated, for example, the market may have al-
ready incorporated the information beforehand, which can actually result
in the market moving in the opposite direction than was expected. Or this
month’s information may be right on the money, but corrections from past
months may end up having a greater impact than was expected. Seasonal
adjustments can result in traders reacting to a different spin than you ex-
pected, or the market may have been too long or too short coming into the
news release, which can trigger a more signiﬁcant auction to adjust inven-
tory imbalances. If you get in before the release, and the market trades in
the opposite direction from your trade, you will ﬁnd yourself in a losing po-
sition that is unfortunate in and of itself, but more importantly, could keep
you out of the winning trade that sets up after the market has digested the
release. Therefore, it’s necessary to maintain maximum ﬂexibility so you
can trade after the market settles down and direction becomes somewhat
clearer.

It’s also a good idea to do your homework and identify signiﬁcant ref-
erence points above or below the current market level, so that you can fade
a release-caused spike that auctions sharply in one direction, with salient
reference points helping you determine if there will be continuation or re-
jection following the spike. Using predetermined levels requires the market
to come to you, rather than you chasing the market.

WHAT YOU DON’T DO MAY BE MORE
IMPORTANT THAN WHAT YOU DO

We stated in the preface to this book that you must understand the way
you process and respond to information. That way your ability to act is not
blocked or distorted by peripheral inﬂuences. In The Mature Mind (Ba-
sic Books, 2005), Gene Cohen discusses two types of intelligence: crystal-
lized intelligence, which is the intelligence we accumulate in school and
from everyday life; and ﬂuid intelligence, which he describes as “on-the-
spot reasoning ability—a kind of raw mental agility that doesn’t depend
completely on prior learning. It includes the speed with which information
can be analyzed as well as attention and memory capacity.” Many traders
constantly listen to business news, visit blogs, talk markets with peers, and
read numerous newsletters—all of which provide conﬂicting opinions for
differing timeframes. For those information hounds, by the time the mar-
ket opens their memory is most likely crammed full, and their attention is

accordingly distracted, pulled in multiple directions. In such instances,
what do suppose happens to their “ﬂuid intelligence”?

The shorter the timeframe you trade, the more important your ﬂuid
intelligence. Intuitively, traders often recognize that they can’t effectively
process this deluge of information, and so fall back on mechanical ap-
proaches or trading systems to decide which trades to execute. But ask
yourself this: What price would you pay for a mechanical system that ac-
tually worked over an extended period of time? There isn’t enough money
in the world to buy such a system, as it would be priceless. What we’re pre-
senting is a more linear thought process that will help you prepare for each
day, as well as monitor the day’s progress once trading begins. Before we
do that, however, let’s review the 30-year bond futures for July 5, 2006.

THE REAL WORLD IN ACTION

We have made it clear that the day-timeframe trader must sort through
extensive information prior to making a decision. Just like other timeframe
traders, volume analysis becomes incredibly important in attempting to
understand the inventory positions of other day-timeframe traders as well
as the actions of the longer timeframes. This is mandatory if you expect to
be a viable opponent. Before we delve into the details of volume analysis,
let’s ﬁrst understand the context.

In 2006, inﬂation (or possibly stagﬂation) once again became the buzz
in the ﬁnancial markets, with the experts constantly missing the mark. In
the Wall Street Journal on July 5, 2006, a headline read: “Sinai Tops Econ-
omy Forecasters With Aggressive Inﬂation View.” The article went on to
say that in the Wall Street Journal‘s December 2005 survey, Decision Eco-
nomics’ Chief Global Economist Allen Sinai topped the list with the most
aggressive forecast—up 3.5 percent for the 12 months ending May 2006.
The article went on to report that the actual number was 4.2 percent. The
survey included 56 economists.

Most market participants closely watch the monthly employment re-
port for signs of growth and indications of inﬂation that can inﬂuence Fed-
eral Reserve policy decisions. In this case, the next report was due to be
made public two days later, on Friday, July 7. Two of the key components
of this report, along with hours worked and wage rates, is the number of
new jobs lost or created as well as the overall rate of employment. Coming
into Wednesday, July 5, the expected number of jobs for the Friday report
was approximately 175,000.

Early Wednesday morning, ADP, a ﬁrm specializing in payrolls and
macroeconomic advisers, predicted that new private sector jobs would
equal 386,000—almost double what was anticipated by the market. With

this background, we can now examine the trading in the Treasury bond for
that fateful Wednesday.

Figure 8.1 revels that the long-term trend is down (at least that is
how we view it—longer-term continuation charts might dispute this assess-
ment), with the market in a balancing phase that has developed for roughly
three months. This three-month range, as you recall, is an intermediate-
term bracket, which calls into play a strategy that suggests buying the
lower end of the bracket and selling the upper end, as long as volume
analysis supports that decision. (Volume isn’t increasing as the market
auctions toward the extremes, indicating change is underway.) Now let’s
expand our analysis to include the individual proﬁle and volume analysis
for Wednesday, July 5.

Viewing Figure 8.2, we see that July 3 was a shortened, preholiday trad-
ing session that demonstrated two forms of balance: (1) It was an inside
day, as it was totally contained within the previous day’s range; and (2) it
was also a narrow, balanced day on its own. As you read in Chapter 7, the
trading strategy is to go with any directional move following a balancing
day.

July 5 gapped lower following the ADP report discussed above and
sold off sharply for the ﬁrst four periods (A through D). Once again, we see
the b formation that indicates short-term inventory liquidation. The buyers
taking the other side of this selling activity are apparently not buying for in-
stant gratiﬁcation, but rather intend to hold for at least a day, if not longer.
It’s not uncommon to see an up-trend day following this kind of formation.
Now review Figure 8.1 and note that the bracket low is at 105’07, with the
low on the 5th at 105’14—only 7 tics from the bracket low. Trade location
for shorts, of any timeframe, was very poor on this day. Trading opportuni-
ties are created when investors/traders act impulsively and don’t consider
the risk/reward of their trade. From the proﬁle shape we see here, we have

evidence that the bonds were not giving up ground easily. Now let’s review
the actual electronic volume to assess conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings.

The settlement, or closing price on the trading day before the one
shown in Figure 8.3, was 106’18, with the POC on the 5th at 105’20. After
opening approximately 1/2 point lower on the 5th, the market continued
to sell off to 105’14, which is approximately $1,100 lower for just one full-
size contract. The most important thing to reﬂect on here is that 68 percent
of the daily volume occurred in the lower portion of the range, which is
from 105’25 down to 105’14. The circled price at 105’23 indicates the closing
price on the 5th. That means almost 68 percent of the short traders from the
5th are going home with a loss. How do you think they feel, with such poor
trade location and already upside down? How might this affect overnight
and early trading on the 6th? How would your thinking have changed if the
proﬁle from the 5th was elongated, volume was more evenly dispersed, and
the close or settle was near the daily low?

Figure 8.4 shows the ﬁrst four periods for the following day, July 6.
The market was clearly higher, forcing short covering, or an “unwinding”
of the overenthusiastic trades of the 5th. An opportunity for a great long

day trade occurred when price could not ﬁnd acceptance back within the
heavy volume range from the 5th. This could also have been an excellent
entry position for short-term traders, which is of course a longer timeframe
than a day trade.

As we discussed at the end of Chapter 7, there can be a moat between
your intellectual analysis and your emotions. You have seen price decline
consistently all day, with the market losing over $1,100 in just two days, and
you are expected to feel comfortable buying it now? Earlier, we said the
brain usually accepts new information at face value, and only gives up this
belief after substantial analysis. Truly great opportunities, by deﬁnition,
only present themselves for a brief period of time. In day trading, there
is rarely sufﬁcient time for substantial on-the-spot analysis; the best trades
are often those that make you feel the most uncomfortable.

Recall that the original estimate for the employment report due out on
the 7th was for approximately 175,000 new jobs. Following the ADP re-
port, several analyses increased their estimate to 200,000. On Friday, when
the actual report was released, U.S. employers added just 121,000 nonfarm

jobs. The number excluding government jobs was 90,000, versus ADP’s
prediction of 386,000. The market rallied. All 56 economists missed the
inﬂation numbers by a wide margin, and most of the estimates for the em-
ployment report were far too high. Next to these types of pell-mell pre-
dictions, market generated-information is an oasis of sanity and objective
clarity.

To nurture and maintain that objective clarity, it’s vital to keep track of
the Big Picture; the following list is meant to get you thinking about your

TOP DOWN

In the ﬁnancial business, the term top down is generally thought of as the
Big Picture, a snapshot of broad economic conditions. To us, however, top
down refers to an understanding of the key driving forces that are inﬂu-
encing a market—they may be economic factors, but they can be other
factors as well. The goal of our top-down approach is to identify these fac-
tors because understanding their nature and inﬂuence can help us more
accurately place all other information into its appropriate context. (There
it is again: context, context, context.)

Once you’ve correctly identiﬁed the top down, it’s paramount to re-
main ﬂexible, as conditions constantly change. For example, you may rec-
ognize that there is a long-term reassessment of PE ratios underway that is
either contracting or expanding PE’s on a long-term basis. And while that
might be extremely important for positioning long-term portfolios, imme-
diate market activity might be inﬂuenced more directly by stock-speciﬁc
earnings. Identifying the reality of what is most inﬂuencing the market
right now is essential if you want to effectively trade the market in any
timeframe, especially if you’re trading the day timeframe.

LACK OF CONVICTION

There will be times when the market is directionless. This phase is com-
monly accompanied by widely gyrating daily price swings, as illustrated by
Figure 8.5.

Although directionless markets offer few opportunities for trend and
intermediate-term traders, they are often fertile ground for day traders be-
cause of their volatility. When markets lack conviction, participants often
attach themselves to short-term themes such as yearend rallies or what is
occurring as we are writing this book—speculating on whether the Fed
pauses in its practice of periodic rate hikes.

Conversely, when markets have intermediate- to longer-term convic-
tion, participants (and therefore the market) will roll right over these
short-term themes if they are counter to the directional auction, and will

accelerate if they are facing the same direction. That’s why making an ac-
curate assessment of the market’s directional conviction is essential to
being able to weight the signiﬁcance—to the market and therefore your
wallet—of shorter-term themes and events.

FLIGHT TO SAFETY

Flights to safety can occur when there are natural disasters, terrorist at-
tacks, wars, political imbroglios, large-scale bankruptcies, or meltdowns

chapter08

MARKETS IN PROFILE

such as occurred with Long-Term Capital Management and the Asian crisis
some years back. Once a ﬂight-to-quality rally is underway, the process for
analyzing markets that we have been describing may, in fact, work against
you for short-term trading. When markets are being driven by fear and emo-
tion, price and volume simply don’t matter. For example, as we are writing
this section, the short-term yield in the Treasury market (six-month bills
yielding 20 more basis points than three-month bills) only makes sense if
you understand that these securities aren’t being purchased for yield, but
rather for safety because of concerns regarding the international political
climate—instability in Iraq, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, and so on. It is imperative
to perform this kind of analysis, for when the ﬂight-to-safety trades are ul-
timately unwound, asymmetric opportunities abound because the market
has usually rallied far above value. Once this unwinding begins, the mar-
ket is likely to return quickly to, and potentially pass through those areas
where price movements weren’t supported by healthy volume.

During a ﬂight-to-safety rally, previous balance areas and brackets are
good visual reference points. Market participants are continually drawn to
recent areas of acceptance (value), and once these areas are taken out, the
market moves to test the next balance area.

INVENTORY IMBALANCES

From time to time, markets get too short in all timeframes. Hedge funds
have contributed to a more realistic employment of investment or trading
ideas in that they simultaneously hold both long and short positions, but
this doesn’t mean that they always get it right. And when hedge fund man-
agers get too short, they too may have to buy to cover, which could add
to market volatility and create opportunities for those who are correctly
reading the market in the present tense.

On the surface, you might wonder why a chapter on day trading would
spend so much time discussing information that is beyond the scope of
the day timeframe. The reason is that if markets become extremely active
during the day, longer-timeframe information may trump day-timeframe in-
formation and take control of the market. On a day that exhibits a nar-
row price range, for example, it is unlikely that there will be much interest
from the longer timeframes. The market may trade in a fairly orderly man-
ner, auctioning back and forth, continually searching for new short-term
information. However, on a day in which the trading range continually in-
creases, longer timeframes may be drawn in, and their participation can
quickly dominate the activity of shorter-term traders. During situations like
this, day traders who have not familiarized themselves with longer-term
context are in a precarious position; unaware that the longer timeframe has

chapter08

155

entered the market, their natural reaction may be to fade what the market
is doing, because it conﬂicts with their day-timeframe analysis. As a re-
sult, they can get run over. This often occurs when the market auctions far
enough to trigger longer-term short covering.

Staying abreast of the top-down drivers isn’t as difﬁcult as it might
seem, because once you’ve completed your long-term analysis, it doesn’t
change that often. Unfortunately, a nice and neat list of the current top-
down drivers will never be found in the newspaper or on the news
shows. This understanding must come from being immersed in the mar-
kets and paying attention to all relevant information. And as always,
the challenge is making sure that you remain objective in your analysis,
keeping outside opinions at bay and focusing on what market-generated
information—always objective—is telling you.

CORRECTION OF INVENTORY IMBALANCES

Let’s focus in on longer-term short covering, as it’s one of the more difﬁcult
top-down drivers to anticipate and detect.

In Figure 8.6, notice that the two lows marked “Excess.” These are con-
sidered to be “good lows,” in that the market auctioned lower, forced out
the ﬁnal laggards (for this timeframe, at least), and immediately found ag-
gressive buyers that led to a reversal of the downward auction. Remember,
excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another in the
opposite direction.

Now examine the third area noted in Figure 8.6. Here, there are mul-
tiple lows at approximately the same price. When a market has repeat-
edly attempted to auction lower without being able to establish excess,
this is usually a sign of inventory imbalance; the market may be too short
to go any lower, and so needs a short-covering rally that will allow long-
term inventory to come into balance. It’s not unusual to hear professional
traders say that a market needs to rally before it can continue to break.
They’re simply expressing the view that there are too many weak sellers
in the market—sellers who continue to cover on each small break, which
has the effect of stopping any further decline until the covering is over.
Shorts are always potential buying power.

Skeptics might point out the ambiguity in this concept, but after years
spent observing this phenomenon in all timeframes, I have come to recog-
nize the fact that longer term short covering is a recurring pattern. Long-
term investors that take large positions in the market don’t wait until the
market gets to within a few tics of a prior low to make their purchases. In
fact, a lot of them aren’t even aware of those levels. Hedge funds and other
intermediate-term traders are very much aware of the prior lows, however,
and once they start feeling insecure in their positions, they begin to look

for opportune levels to cover their shorts, and prior intermediate-term lows
offer a sense of stability.

These are particularly difﬁcult periods for intermediate-term buyers,
because they don’t believe the long- or intermediate-term low has been
established—yet the trade is to go long. Conversely, for sellers, getting
stubborn on your short (waiting for more proﬁt) can be extremely painful,
as short-covering rallies can be swift. Figure 8.7 illustrates what the begin-
ning of one of these rallies looks like when viewed through the lens of the
market proﬁle.

Day 1 and 2 clearly exhibit the familiar p pattern, with Day 3 bringing
the market into balance with an inside day. Then Day 4 once again demon-
strates the short covering p pattern.

Figure 8.8 (see page 159) combines the individual proﬁle days from Fig-
ure 8.7 into a single, multi-day proﬁle. The mirror image of the p pattern, is
of course the b formation; just as markets can get too short to go any lower,
they can get too long to go any higher, and often have to break before they
can rally. Inventory imbalances such as this occur in all timeframes, and
under both trending and bracketing conditions.

TREND TRADERS’ TRAP

Over the years, I have observed many trend-following systems, as well as
trend traders who fail to differentiate between “old business” and “new

chapter08

business,” thinking that they have identiﬁed a new trend only to have that
trade quickly collapse. Long-only investors often feel comfortable as short
covering propels their positions higher, failing to recognize this activity as
an opportunity to lighten up or rearrange their portfolios. Long-only man-
agers who are not fully invested often consider themselves to be short, as
they are under committed to the market.

Remember: “Long only, Fully Invested” Is a Trend-Following
Approach These traders and money managers are employing only price
to further their understanding. Short covering, once it is completed, leaves
the market with reduced underlying buying potential. Once the short cov-
ering is over, the market can quickly revert toward the mean, leaving trend
traders with big losses. conversely, long liquidation depletes the market of
selling potential, which will often set the stage for a meaningful rally that
carries price substantially beyond the levels that triggered the liquidation
in the ﬁrst place.

Understanding markets and trading is similar to running any busi-
ness in which inventory is important; how would you like to be a retailer
in the late fall with the wrong merchandise? Think “going out of busi-
ness sale”—inventory reduction with everything marked down 25 percent.
We’ve spent a lot of time discussing top-down factors because how they
can dominate the market—if only for a fairly brief period of time—can
have an extremely positive effect on your bottom line.

MARKET CONDITION

After reviewing the dominant force currently driving the market, we want
to determine if this is occurring within a trending or bracketing envi-
ronment. We have covered everything you’ll encounter here elsewhere in
the book; however, successful trading/investing is about rearranging myr-
iad pieces that enables us to better view the constantly changing market
puzzle.

In The Grace of Great Things: Creativity and Innovation (New York:
Ticknor and Fields, 1990), Robert Grudin uses the phrase “discovery by
anomaly” when discussing Thomas Kuhn and his book The Structure of
Scientiﬁc Revolution. Grudin writes that discovery occurs when you no-
tice the anomaly of the uninvited quest (presence of an unexpected fac-
tor), the anomaly of the empty chair (discovery that a necessary factor
is missing), and the anomaly of rearrangement (all factors are present
but strangely rearranged). Going from trending to bracketing or brack-
eting to trending is an example of the anomaly of rearrangement; once
the pieces are rearranged, the expected outcome changes. Those who

don’t notice the rearrangement are left expecting an outcome that will
never occur.

If we determine that the market is trending, the next step is to deter-
mine if the trend is young, aging, or old. You will recall that one of the key
ways to measure the age of a trend is not by price movement, but by the
relationship of successive balance areas: If there is distance between one
balance area and the next the trend is young; as the balance areas begin
to come closer together or overlap, the trend is aging. Measuring volume
on days with the intermediate-term auction, and contrasting it with days
against the same auction will also help reveal the maturity of the larger
auction.

If the market is bracketing, then a visual inspection will enable us to
determine exactly where within the bracket the market is currently trad-
ing. You should write down your observations, recording at least the high,
low, and center of the bracket. Next, you should perform and notate vol-
ume analysis to determine the nature of market activity near the bracket
extremes. The reason we emphasize writing everything down is so you
can lean on your notations as the market heats up, as stress narrows your
thought processes. Finally, we want to more closely examine the bracket
for internal balance areas, or trading ranges, as well as shorter-term trends
within the bracket.

Early on we pointed out that the terms trending and bracketing are
applicable to all timeframes. For example, there can be a single trend day
as well as a single balancing day. And with a closer look, you can iden-
tify smaller balancing areas within a single day. Trends can occur within
bracketing markets, and long-term trends are occasionally interrupted by
shorter-term balancing areas. For this reason, we would suggest that day-
timeframe traders operating within a bracketing environment perform a
running analysis. That way they will always be aware of changing condi-
tions within that bracket.

In Figure 8.9, the letter A identiﬁes multiple examples of excess, which
mark the ending of one auction and the beginning of another auction in
the opposite direction. Numbers 1 through 4 provide examples of smaller
internal balance areas within the larger bracket. Common successful day
trades, as we have said, involve fading moves to the balance-area extremes
on low volume, and looking for breakouts from the balance ranges on such
moves that attract increasing volume.

One of the most interesting trading opportunities occurs when price
auctions just beyond a balance area’s extreme. Because balance areas
are by deﬁnition visual, you can expect to ﬁnd stops just beyond their
extremes—stops that are likely to be irresistible to short-term traders.
When these stops are taken out and the activity in the direction of the

bracket’s boundary simply dries up, then you can be relatively sure that
the move was caused by day traders pushing price just high enough to take
out the stops placed there. This is a good opportunity to fade, as the market
will likely reverse and plunge back into the bracket. If, on the other hand,
the stops are taken out and the market settles there for a while, the odds
are good that a balance-area breakout has occurred, which requires that
you place a trade with the breakout. Next in this chapter, we discuss how
to monitor such a trade for continuation.

The arrow marked “trend” in Figure 8.9, though within an intermediate-
term bracket, should be traded just like any trend: go with it, don’t fade it.
These intra-bracket trends tend to originate at one extreme of the bracket
and once underway often auction all the way to the opposite extreme.
It can be difﬁcult to place the correct trade when a trend starts from a
bracket-area extreme, because it’s likely that you just witnessed several
days of the market auctioning, or stair-stepping, in the direction opposite
the new trend. But if you have been keeping a written record and have de-
scribed the bracket correctly, you will realize that such trade location is

chapter08

MARKETS IN PROFILE

ideal—the distance to the opposite end of the bracket is much greater than
a potential move in the opposite direction, back beyond the bracket ex-
treme, which should trigger an exit. We discuss other exit strategies later
in this chapter.

We continually stress the importance of understanding context, and
knowing where you are within a bracket is a contextual matter. Unless
you have accurately recorded the bracket’s description and placed the cur-
rent price correctly within that context, rapid market activity at key tran-
sitional points is likely to appear blurred and indecipherable. That’s why
you want to continually perform your analysis, comparing volume num-
bers and assessing the inventory situation of your competitors. In real es-
tate, for example, you hear the mantra “location, location, location.” When
day- and short-term trading, continually think, “inventory, inventory, inven-
tory.” Our position is that markets are not efﬁcient, and all opportunities
are not equal, so it follows that just like in blackjack, what has already been
played changes the odds of the next hand.

Up to now, we have been reviewing the past from the top down. Let’s
now focus even more sharply on the previous day as yet another step in
preparing for a successful day trade.

YESTERDAY’S TRADE

Every day, we begin by asking ourselves What was the market attempting
to do yesterday, and how successful was that attempt? The four elements
we will initially examine are attempted direction, value-area placement,
proﬁle shape, and volume. We will conduct this examination via three ex-
amples.

Example 1

Looking at the “discussion day” in Figure 8.10, we see that the previous
day was a trend day up, closing on the high. On the day in question, the
market opened near the high for the day and attempted to sell off for the
ﬁrst two periods before ﬁnding balance almost exactly in the center of
the proﬁle—a progression that is much clearer in Figure 8.11, which shows
the same proﬁle with each time period noted separately. You will notice
that while price was lower for the day, value was clearly higher,
as the previous day’s value was below the late upward price spike. We con-
tinue to stress that value is far more important than price. Price is simply
the mechanism the market employs to advertise for opportunities; some
opportunities are accepted, while others are rejected.

The split proﬁle reveals that during the ﬁrst two periods, B and C, the
market auctioned lower without any ability to establish lower value for the
day. Price traders could feel that the market was weak to neutral, as price
was lower to unchanged for most of the day. Value traders, on the other
hand, recognized that value was clearly higher. Late in the afternoon, the
market attempted to break out of the nine period balance area called out in

the square box. Volume was weak during the attempted breakout, and the
market was unable to take out the previous day’s high—two key indicators
that set the stage for a reversion-to-the-mean trade (see mean center in
Figure 8.10).

What we are really observing, here, is a short-term liquidation situation,
as anyone getting long late in the day was accumulating inventory at prices

near the high for the past several days. The lack of upside follow-through,
combined with the fact that daytime trading would close in an hour, forced
many local and day traders to liquidate. Failure to differentiate between
long liquidation of short-term inventory versus new shorts being placed in
the market would lead you to starkly divergent views; new shorts would be
a clear sign of market weakness, while short-term long liquidation would
be just that, and not an overall sign of weakness. Remember: value was
clearly higher.

The following day opened sharply higher, setting new short-term
highs. Had price traders gotten short near the highs late on this day and
held through the close, they would likely have thought, This feels pretty
good—why not take this trade home short and see what happens tomor-
row? A trader that focuses on value would have been in a better position to
recognize that the security remained strong, and would probably auction
higher on the following day.

Volume was not a consideration in this example, because we only em-
ploy overall volume when we can be certain of which direction the market
was attempting to auction throughout the day, and the day in Figure 8.11
exhibited no such clarity.

Example 2

The day discussed in Figure 8.12 exhibited the classic b formation as the
market traded toward the multiple-day low. We have already discussed the
market’s tendency to go after stops, and there would almost certainly have
been stops just below the price that represented the low for the past sev-
eral days. If the market was truly weak in the day timeframe, the short-term
traders would have been able to push below that price and trigger the stops
lurking there. It’s important to be able to distinguish between the various
timeframes: the day timeframe is not weak enough to push the auction be-
low recent lows, and the next longer timeframe is showing more weakness
as price is being accepted, over time, at this lower level. If these lower
prices were too low, for the day timeframe, you would see single print buy-
ing tails at these lows.

This is an extremely complex discussion, and probably one of the most
meaningful concepts for a day-timeframe trader to grasp. If you can mas-
ter what is occurring in Figure 8.12, then you are beginning to develop
advanced market knowledge. If you can also execute proﬁtable trades
around this knowledge, then you have successfully combined “market” un-
derstanding with “self” understanding.

The belly of the b,

indicated on the “Initial discussion day” in
Figure 8.12, represents the mean for the day, and unless we see price move
away from this level on substantial volume, we are likely to see these prices

revisited. We are always looking for clues today about what is likely to tran-
spire tomorrow, and so I would look for an opportunity to sell above the b
or buy below the b on the next trading day with the expectation that this
level would be revisited.

On the following day, the market opens slightly lower and auctions
beneath the multiple-day low, triggering the stops we suspected were just
beneath that level and sending the market down sharply. In the same pe-
riod, however, the market does indeed work its way back up toward and
ﬁnally through the fat part of the previous day’s b loop.

We have a bonus day in this example, as we can see the mirror image
of the b formation—the p formation—as the market rallies from the early

167

morning lows back toward the low of the initial day. For the day following,
I would look to sell above or buy below the p, with the expectation that
price will revisit price levels in the fat part of the p loop. A good question
to ask, at this point, would be, “Why did the market trade sharply above the
p late on the bonus day, only to return to this level the following day?” The
answer is probably that most of the morning selling was a consequence
of the stops we discussed. Once those were “hit” (elected), sending prices
lower, momentum sellers piled on, getting short in the hole. In addition,
some price-based systems had their selling indicators triggered as prices
broke to new recent lows. In the initial period (B), we observed a very long
buying tail at the low, which alerted us to the fact that at least the next
longer timeframe buyer was accepting the advertised opportunity to buy
MRK (Merck) below value. This buying squeezed the shorts, and those who
hadn’t gotten their day timeframe shorts back as the market approached
the close were forced to cover.

We hope you feel the complexity of the short-term market. But at the
same time recognize that it is tradable if you can keep an open, ﬂexi-
ble mind, and appreciate the importance of developing structure. Market
structure varies every day, minute to minute, and the auction process con-
stantly evolves, providing us with an objective, multidimensional glimpse
of real time market activity. I view recognizable trading ranges, such as
those that manifest during short covering and long liquidation, as struc-
tural weaknesses that have to be re-inspected—that’s where opportunity
lies.

Example 1 was primarily a balancing day that failed to auction success-
fully out of balance to either side of the mean because each attempt failed
to attract sufﬁcient volume to successfully migrate price to new value
areas. Remember, either value will be pulled to the new price, or price will
return to value.

Example 2 was more complex, as the market attempted a downside
breakout from several days of overlapping price and value. That attempt
failed, because the early selling was met by aggressive responsive buyers
(as evidenced by the long buying tail). These buyers were strong enough
to force the morning shorts to cover. What these two days have in com-
mon is that short-term traders were best served by fading the exploratory
price moves. Both examples offered sufﬁcient clues with which to set early
expectations for the following days. Let’s now examine a day that suggests
continuation.

Figure 8.14 displays the proﬁle graphics that correspond to these same

two days.

Let’s look at the downside breakout in the S&Ps to see what market
structure suggested for the following day. The market gapped lower on
the opening, which is a sign of crisis or reorganization (Kuhn’s “paradigm
change”). The day’s proﬁle remained elongated, and late in the afternoon
prices accelerated to the downside, still seeking enough buyers to enable
the market to come into balance. Earlier, we provided an average volume
range with 1.6 billion shares on the lower end and 2 billion on the upper
end. Volume for this day was 1.8 billion. Now let’s put it all together: the
gap, elongation, decent volume, and a close near the low suggest downside
continuation on the following day. Looking ahead, you can see that the
market did, indeed, continue its downward march.

Before actually placing and managing a day trade, make sure you stan-
dardize your decision-making process, to some extent; the goal is not to en-
force rigid thinking, but to make sure you are looking at the potential trade
within its proper context. From experience, I expect any serious trader to
design their own checklist, but the following section will give you some
guidance on where to start.

✔ Ideal trades you would like to execute based on analysis of yester-

day’s trade:

Earlier in the book, we deﬁned the two primary functions of the mar-
ket’s two-way auction process: (1) the efﬁcient and fair allocation of bids
and offers; and (2) the constant search for information. As part of this on-
going process, the market often explores above the previous day’s highs
and lows, weekly highs and lows, monthly highs and lows, prior balance
areas highs and lows, long-term bracket highs and lows, and so on. The
permutations are too numerous to list and change constantly depending
on context and timeframe. Therefore, it’s important that you develop the
expertise that will enable you to identify these reference points, so that
when the market gets a response at one of these pivotal levels, you will be
prepared to judge its importance. You should begin each day with your
own list of reference points—they will be your roadmap to successful
trading.

THE MARKET IS OPEN

Once the market opens, the key question is this: In what direction is the
market attempting to auction, and how successful does the auction ap-
pear to be? It can be helpful to personify the concept, and think in terms
of how much “conﬁdence” the auction appears to have. Years ago, Peter
Steidlmayer classiﬁed openings into four categories, which I still believe
are valid. We view these four types of openings as initial gauges of early
market conviction:

1. Open-Drive

2. Open-Test-Drive
3. Open-Rejection-Reverse

4. Open-Auction

Open-Drive

The strongest and most deﬁnitive type of open is the Open-Drive, in which
the market opens and auctions aggressively in one direction. In Mind over
Markets, the analogy we used was that of a race horse that explodes out of
the gate and never looks back. The Open-Drive results in the lowest odds
of opening prices being revisited, which provides you with an early market
reference point; if price returns to the opening, you know that something
has changed since the early morning, and chances are much higher that the

chapter08

MARKETS IN PROFILE

day will end with the market auctioning in the opposite direction. Figure
8.15 illustrates this type of opening.

Before we deﬁne the other three types of openings, let’s take a moment
to review that old familiar concept: context. Imagine yourself sitting in a
seminar. You’re being taught how to proﬁt using market-generated infor-
mation, and I say, “Now we will deﬁne the four types of openings and how
to proﬁt from them.” This kind of declaration is generally accompanied by
a wave of comfort radiating throughout the audience, as each participant
readies their pencil and paper to take careful notes on the four different
types of openings—notes that will be concrete and easily memorized. (Af-
ter all, isn’t that why you attended the seminar?) While these notes will
appear absolute to many, they are merely a starting point.

Ask.com deﬁnes cognition with a lot of descriptive words and phrases.
Among them are: “a very broad term, which is not easy to describe,” and
“mechanisms involved in such process in human beings as perception, at-
tention, learning, thought, concept formation, reading, problem solving,
and the development of such behavior.” True cognitive learning only be-
gins when you realize that you have to transcend the limitations of ﬁxed
deﬁnitions in order to discover how markets really operate. Each opening
has to be placed within a much broader context. On several occasions, we
have used the phrase “immersed in the markets.” This is just another way
of saying that you have to be deeply, personally involved in the markets
before you can begin to discover just how much of your creative energy
is required before you can begin to travel down the path toward being an
expert trader.

Now, back to those “notes.”
The Open-Drive is the highest-conﬁdence opening; the ﬁrst example
(Figure 8.15) shows the Open-Drive followed by a sharp downward trend
that continued throughout the entire day, gapping lower on the following
day. Now let’s review the same Open-Drive in different contexts. Figure
8.16 shows the same day illustrated in Figure 8.15, but with more per-
spective provided; we’ve added the day prior, which was an inside day (its
entire range contained within the range of the previous day). As we have
stated, inside days are a form of balance, and when a market comes out of
balance it is likely to attract multiple timeframes, which adds to the result-
ing volatility. In this instance, the market had already turned down (not
shown), so the Open-Drive in question was also with the current trend.

Figure 8.17 also illustrates an Open-Drive. However, the circum-
stances are somewhat different. In Figure 8.16, the auction had already
turned down and the opening was with the intermediate-term trend; in
Figure 8.17, the long-term auction was still up (not shown) and so the
Open-Drive occurred against the intermediate-term trend, and within the
prior day’s range, which means that it is still within balance and unlikely to

attract as much attention. The context for both examples is quite different,
resulting in different expectations going into the following day for each.
To reiterate, Figure 8.16 displays an Open-Drive with the trend and out of
balance to the downside, and as a result, large downward movement in
both price and value occur; the Figure 8.17 Open-Drive is against the major
auction and within balance, resulting in only moderate changes in price,
with value overlapping to slightly lower.

By deﬁnition, an Open-Drive starts out with high conﬁdence, and if
that conﬁdence continues throughout the day, you would expect to see
the proﬁle elongate, with value being gradually pulled along with price.
Remember, price is the fastest moving element, and value develops much
more slowly. On the day following an Open-Drive, you would expect to see
the market open outside of value in the direction of the Open-Drive, or at
least value beginning to build outside of the previous day’s value area.

When you start to see developments that contradict the descriptions
above, you should quickly realize that the conﬁdence level is declining,
and if your day trade is in the same direction as the Open-Drive, your risk
is increasing along with the odds of a reversal. If the market continues
as expected, on the other hand, then maintain your position and let the
market work for you, monitoring activity for signs that the initial optimism
inherent in the Open-Drive is beginning to wane, which would suggest that
you should exit your trade; your goal should be to become proﬁcient at
exiting trades of your own free volition, rather than waiting for stops to
take you out. This practice will boost your conﬁdence level (not to mention
your bank account).

Open-Test-Drive

An Open-Test-Drive is similar to the Open-Drive, except that the market
lacks the initial conﬁdence necessary to drive immediately following the
opening bell. During this type of opening, the market generally opens and
tests beyond a known reference point—such as a previous high or low—to
make sure there is no business to be done in that direction. The market
then reverses and quickly auctions back through the opening; a failed test
in one direction followed by a strong reversal often secures one of the ex-
tremes for the day.

In the late 1980s, when I was responsible for an institutional trading
desk, it was quite common to receive large institutional orders with in-
structions to wait 15 minutes before beginning to execute the trade—the
institution didn’t want to be embarrassed if there was substantial business
to be done in the direction opposite their order. For example, if they were
selling, they didn’t want to sell at $40 per share if the market was going to
auction quickly to $42 per share. An Open-Test-Drive is the second most

reliable type of opening. Once the market has tested in the opposite direc-
tion and found strong opposite activity, the odds are high that the initial
extreme will not be revisited for the remainder of the day.

Figure 8.18 illustrates an Open-Test-Drive. While we didn’t show it in
the example, the upward test auctioned up to the previous day’s high,
where sellers quickly stepped in and sold with conﬁdence. The analysis

following the “Drive” portion of an Open-Test-Drive is exactly the same
as discussed for the Open-Drive: you would expect to see elongation,
lower value and price, and so on. Once again, the contradictions—like
footnotes to an accounting document—are where the real information is
hidden.

Training yourself to constantly think in terms of market conﬁdence is a
meaningful way to help to decide when to enter and exit trades. For exam-
ple, while the Open-Test Drive is a high-conﬁdence opening, the conﬁdence
is not quite as high as an Open-Drive, which should lead you to adjust your
expectations accordingly.

Open-Rejection-Reverse

The Open-Rejection-Reverse is characterized by a market that opens,
trades in one direction and then meets opposite activity strong enough to
reverse the auction and drive it back through the opening range. The think-
ing process following this kind of open should be along the same lines as
what we discussed before: Ask yourself how much conﬁdence is embodied
by the market’s early auctions. The three types of openings we have de-
scribed thus far differ in the amount of conﬁdence that surrounds them.
The weaker the opening, the greater the odds that price auctions back
and forth through both the opening range and the early morning highs and
lows.

When a market ﬁnally decides to auction directionally, we are always
trying to determine how long to stay with the trade—a decision that should
be based around how much conﬁdence the market is exhibiting in the di-
rectional move. The opening type is simply one factor in assessing market
conﬁdence. Probably the most used and least reliable conﬁdence indicator
is price.

Figure 8.19 shows the opening followed by a downward auction that is
rejected, as evidenced by the single print buying tail in y period. The prices
that were being offered as the market made a new auction low were quickly
accepted by the responsive buyer, who believed that prices were too low
and represented a good deal. Had the market auctioned at these lower
prices in two consecutive time periods, instead of only one (as shown in
the box), the market would have shown a lesser degree of conﬁdence. The
fast rejection reveals the fact that buyers had conﬁdence, at least in the
early going. The market then reversed and auctioned higher—thus the la-
bel “Open-Rejection-Reverse.”

The conﬁdence at the lower extreme—because the direction wasn’t de-
termined from the opening bell—would be classiﬁed as “lower.” This sim-
ply means that the possibility of the market reversing, later in the day, has
to be given serious consideration. Nothing should be viewed in isolation,
however, as there are many factors that help us judge the strength of an
auction. We’ve already noted factors such as developing value area place-
ment, volume associated with the auction, and elongated proﬁle structure,
which at a glance reveals a higher degree of conﬁdence than a proﬁle that
has begun to fatten.

The example in Figure 8.20 demonstrates another sign of auction con-

ﬁdence, which is best explained visually.

Once the rejection occurred in y period, no subsequent half-hour time
period trades below the previous period’s lowest price. We call this type
of activity a one-way auction, or an auction that is one-timeframing. A
costly error traders make is fading a one-timeframing auction. Even if

Open-Auction

Open-Auction activity initially reﬂects a market with no conviction at all.
The market opens and appears to randomly auction above and below the
opening range. In reality, the conviction reﬂected by the Open-Auction
largely depends on where the market opens relative to the previous day.
An Open-Auction that occurs inside the previous day’s range, for example,
conveys a much different opinion regarding potential day-timeframe devel-
opment than an Open-Auction that occurs outside that range. In general,
if a market opens and auctions within the previous day’s value area and
range, then a nonconvictional day will usually develop. The same open-
ing occurring outside yesterday’s range, however, demonstrates a mar-
ket that is out of balance relative to the previous day, which greatly in-
creases the odds of a dramatic price move in either direction. If the market
quickly returns to the previous day’s range and reenters the value area, the
odds are good that the market will continue on to the opposite extreme of
that day’s range. Failure to return to yesterday’s range increases the odds
of a meaningful, directional move in the direction of the out-of-balance
opening.

Figure 8.21 demonstrates an Open-Auction, with price trading both
above and below the opening for each of the ﬁrst ﬁve periods. When you
hear people talk about successful trading requiring patience, that principle
is never more applicable in the day timeframe than after an Open-Auction.
Whether the market is in or out of balance, there is no reason for a day-
timeframe trader to trade during the ﬁrst ﬁve periods of an Open-Auction
day. When the market lacks conviction for that long, the odds favor limited
range development for the remainder of the day, which translates to lim-
ited opportunities. (Mind over Markets covers day-time directional devel-
opment relative to these openings in much greater detail than space allows
in this book.)

In sum, the lack of short-term conviction surrounding the opening
range suggests that day traders should wait patiently until the market ar-
rives at a directional consensus.

DAY TRADER’S CHECKLIST

As was stated earlier, every experienced trader has his or her own sys-
tem of checks and balances. The following checklist is designed to get
you further down the road to developing your own personal preparation
process.

range. (There is no set answer—you should be guided by your past ob-
servations of where price slowed or accelerated, as well as past areas
of heavy or light volume.)

✔ Note what kind of opening is occurring, as well as what you’d want to

see in order to quickly judge the resulting directional conﬁdence.

✔ Note whether or not there is clear attempted direction, and whether

that activity is supported by volume.

✔ Does the market appear to be within balance or out of balance?
✔ Visualize the remainder of the day. Will it look elongated, squat, fairly
normal like a bell-shaped curve, and the like. Note any unusual shapes
or patterns that may suggest something unexpected is happening.
✔ Estimate how much effort is being expended to move price direction-
ally, and note what that suggests about the inventory conditions of
your competitors—too long, too short, above water, below water, etc.
✔ If there is a major news announcement scheduled, be aware that there
could be unexpected volatility. Let the market provide short-term in-
terpretation of resulting activity by observing developing structure.
Unless the day-timeframe structure is extremely strong and unlikely
to be reversed by such an announcement, we recommend that day
traders be ﬂat in front of signiﬁcant numbers.

Let’s examine three different markets, beginning with the opening bell.

This discussion both summarizes and abbreviates this checklist.

Example 1

The ﬁrst example (see Figure 8.22) enables us to view two high-conﬁdence
openings occurring within different contexts—one takes price outside of
balance and one results in price maintaining equilibrium. To recap, when
price moves outside of balance, the odds are that there will be more volatil-
ity and a greater range than when price remains within balance. Here’s
another way to think about this: The status quo is maintained when the
market remains within balance, but the status quo has changed once the
market leaves balance, which generally results in additional timeframes
joining the fray.

We labeled the different types of openings to facilitate their descrip-
tion. But please remember that the labels are far less important than the
amount of conﬁdence that is indicated by each opening. Day 1 shows high
conﬁdence, selling from the opening bell with price rapidly auctioning be-
low both the value area and the range for the prior day. It doesn’t take long
for you to visualize lower value for Day 1; you should quickly short this

market—go with the open—once price moves below the previous day’s
range, with the expectation that value will be pulled down to price. You
should also track volume to assure yourself that lower prices are attract-
ing additional activity.

The b pattern begins to form in the ﬁfth time period of Day 1, and con-
tinues to develop for the remainder of the day. The expected market struc-
ture for a day with early high conﬁdence would be an elongated proﬁle
shape; as soon as it becomes clear that the expected is not going to happen,
it’s time to exit a short position—even if the market continues lower, the
odds are building against you. Mechanically, this was a simple day trade,

chapter08

but the emotional ramiﬁcation of such a trade is far more complex. You
had to act quickly, you had to sell something cheaper than you could have
sold it for at any time during the prior day, and there was nothing to re-
ally measure your risk against. A different mindset would see risk as low
due to all the selling that is forcing prices lower. But your mind should
have awakened when the market failed to go much lower relative to the
ﬁfth time period—time to cover. The goal is to exit trades based upon mar-
ket structure, not based upon price; your observations, not a stop. When a
stop is triggered, the market is responsible for the outcome. When you exit
a trade on deteriorating structure, then you are clearly in charge.

The b pattern that developed on Day 1 tells us that the odds are high
that we’ll have to trade to the upside at some point tomorrow. The short
evidence says that the sellers on this day were not new sellers, but rather
short term long stock liquidators. The b patterns provides evidence that the
selling was being accumulated by a longer timeframe that expected to take
new longs home overnight.

Day 2 also had a high-conﬁdence opening, with the major difference be-
ing that price remained within the previous day’s value area, which demon-
strates a market without much conﬁdence. The strong upward opening that
was searching for sellers found those sellers near the opening of Day 1,
which was just below the bottom of that day’s value area. Our upper refer-
ences should have been: (1) the previous day’s low; (2) the previous day’s
opening; and (3) the low of the previous day’s value area. There was never
any price acceptance at any of these reference points—the market did not
spend enough time there to reestablish value. Because Day 1 had a wide
range, indicating acceptance, and Day 2 fails to auction above Day’s 1 high,
the expectation would be for a narrow, range-bound day. By periods 6 and
7 (G and H), it appears that this is, in fact, a narrow balancing day with lim-
ited opportunities. The key to developing this insight early is to put yourself
in the buyers’ shoes, examining their mindset.

Figure 8.23 demonstrates Day 2 in its entirety—it remained within the
range established by its opening period, which signaled that the odds of
any real change were low. You should have quickly visualized that this
market was unlikely to do anything meaningful over the rest of this day;
there was never any real, new long-term buying, as the combination of
short covering and new long-term buying would have caused the proﬁle to
elongate.

Example 2

The day that preceded Day 1 in Figure 8.24 exhibits unusual width in
the lower portion of the proﬁle (circled area). By now we know that the

low conﬁdence, as the market is effectively seeking guidance, which can
be provided by price levels that have drawn attention in the past. An-
other of our top reference points for Day 1 would be the previous day’s
high.

Day 1 opened and traded both above and below the opening, as well
as above the previous day’s high, in the ﬁrst period. C period contin-
ued this low-conﬁdence action, suggesting that short-term traders should
be patient and wait to act until the market decides which way it’s go-
ing to trade. The failure to ﬁnd acceptance (over time) above the pre-
vious day’s high tells us that this day is not going to build value out of
balance to the upside; the market auctioned above the previous day’s
high and discovered that activity was cut off—higher prices dampened
activity.

At this point, the market can be expected to explore lower. As you can
see, lower prices attracted additional sellers instead of cutting off activity,
therefore the market needs to continue lower until it can lure in buyers and
return to balance. Notice that in G period the downward auction acceler-
ated quickly, reaching the area circled and labeled “unusual width.” There
was never any reason for a day trader to exit this trade until the close, as
the proﬁle remained elongated and price again accelerated as the previous
day’s low was taken out.

One last note: once an auction looks above a previous high and fails,
or looks below a previous low and fails, you should immediately recognize
the possibility of an auction to the opposite extreme.

Figure 8.25 simply allows you to see the ﬁnished, collapsed proﬁle of

the day we just discussed.

Example 3

We’re concluding Chapter 8 with the example shown in Figure 8.26 because
it addresses the essence of day trading: What is the market attempting to
do, and what grade does it get for its effort?

In Example 3, the market opens with low conﬁdence. However, lower
price gets accepted in B and C periods, which increases the odds that value
will also migrate lower. Periods D and E extend the auction to the down-
side, giving the impression that this will continue to be a weak day. A rally
in G period carries the auction back to the C period high, where you will
notice that it also trades back into the previous day’s range. The market
once again sells off, but doesn’t even come close to the early morning low.
On days like this the market can appear to be weak, trapping you unless
you continually ask yourself, “What is the market getting for its effort?”
In this case, while the market has continually sold off, the net effect is
very little change, and by the end of the day price actually closes higher.

Conﬁdence was low surrounding the opening, and the constant reentry
into the previous day’s range—when the market was attempting to auc-
tion lower—reveals more proof of low conﬁdence on the downside. You
must continually ask yourself: What is the inventory position of my com-
petitors, and can I anticipate their actions as the day goes on?

All of the examples just discussed are applicable for round-turn day
traders as well as institutional clients who are executing one side of a trade.
Remember the question often posed by institutional traders: I have a large
order, should I ﬁll it now or will I have the whole day to work on it?

PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE

We generally think of the type of analysis we’ve conducted in this chap-
ter as something purely objective and logical. But we are all human and

chapter08

191

subject to our uniquely shifting emotional currents. Without factoring in
emotion, you can’t even begin to understand risk—of any kind. As objec-
tive as your analysis might be, if you are too emotionally involved, your
decision-making abilities will suffer and you may ﬁnd yourself focusing
only on worst-case scenarios. Successful analysis must therefore take into
account the way you process information, which is part of the larger con-
text in which you trade and invest. The whole-brained trader does not get
lost in unrelated particulars or subjective desire, instead continually seek-
ing to understand a sense of the larger whole.

It is important to note here that this holistic insight ultimately has no
bearing on how well you implement your understanding. You can intu-
itively grasp the fundamental concepts we’re discussing, but you must also
spend a substantial amount of time engaged in real work—researching on
your own, studying patterns until they come second nature, mastering your
emotional involvement in the ﬁnancial implications of trading—before you
can ascend to the ranks of the top performing money traders.

I once read that the best way to learn is to practice something over
and over, subtly altering circumstances on each iteration. This is how we
gain experience and the ﬂexibility required to make rapid adjustments. The
analogy I have used before is that of an experienced surgeon: while the
surgeon does considerable prep work—looking at X-rays, reviewing the pa-
tient’s medical history, etc.—once the incision is made there will always be
minute differences to which he or she must adjust on the ﬂy. But because
the doctor has experienced untold numbers of similar situations, the slight
variations are taken in stride, are accommodated with calm efﬁciency, and
the operation proceeds without mishap.

Top professionals in any ﬁeld are mentally prepared, they are engaged,
and they have the right mental state with which to perform their duties with
a clear, open mind—without being overwhelmed by conﬂicting stimulus or
emotion.

Proﬁting from
Market-
Generated
Information

A common fallacy is the idea that the majority sets
the pattern and the trends of social, economic, and
religious life. History reveals quite the opposite: the
majority copies or imitates the minority and this
establishes the long-run developments and socio-
economic evolutions.

—Humphrey Neill

Life is endlessly complex and mysterious. It’s no wonder people tend

to favor clean lines and clear objectives. And as much as we like
to think of ourselves as individuals and freethinkers, we all long for
easy, straightforward answers. When you consider the demands of modern
living—cell phones ringing, bills to pay, relationships to nurture, endless
e-mail cascading through the ether—it’s no wonder everyone’s looking for
that magical black box. But, of course, there’s no such thing.

One of the core directives of this book is that learning isn’t linear, and
that to successfully trade, you must train your mind to be agile, able to
ﬂuidly shift between timeframes and mindsets to accommodate the ever-
changing auction. You have to accept the fact that you will never be cer-
tain, but if you improve your market understanding in conjunction with a
better understanding of how you process information and make decisions,
you can develop a more intuitive ability to identify those situations when
the odds are in your favor (over time, you’ll recognize that they occur more
often than you might think).

Nietzsche said, “Belief in truth begins with doubting all that has hith-
erto been believed to be true.” This mirrors the Humphrey Neill quote at the

beginning of this chapter. If you sense the power and potential in this book,
then welcome to the minority. It is only the minority—the “innovators” and
“early adopters”—that ﬁrst respond to a change in the dominant paradigm.
All this talk of “asymmetric trade location” challenges, by its very nature,
the status quo. But think on this: In trading, as in all things, it is the
well-positioned minority that beneﬁts from the actions of the majority.

TIMEFRAME DIVERSIFICATION

We’ve come at last to the simple question that lies at the heart of this
book: Why not have a portfolio that is both long and short? Most would
agree that such an approach makes perfect sense. Yet few actually do it. If
you’ve already done your homework on individual securities—and you’re
any good at it—then you should have come across both long and short op-
portunities. When you consider the risks inherent in being “all one way”
in markets that have repeatedly proved that they can reverse on a dime,
timeframe diversiﬁcation is a far more efﬁcient use of your resources
because it enables you to employ all of your research to develop market
ideas—not just the results that indicate possible long positions. The May
nonlinear break in stocks that we used for so many of our illustrations was
also a marvelous example of the beneﬁts of timeframe diversiﬁcation. Case
in point: On July 14, I received the following e-mail from a friend at State
Street Global Advisors in Boston:

From: Brian Shannahan
Date: July 14, 2006
To: Jim Dalton
Subject: since the peak in early May
A thing of beauty. . .<.79> vs <6.22> net 5.44.

State Street Global Advisors is one of the top ﬁve institutional money
managers in the world. They are number one in institutional as-
sets with approximately $1.5 trillion under management. Prior to
my retirement from UBS Financial Services, I had asked State
Street to develop a long-short portfolio for our clients based upon
our speciﬁcations—basically 70 percent long and 30 percent short
securities—with directions to rebalance to the 70/30 mix any time
the shorts reached either 25 percent or 35 percent.

Brian’s e-mail was informing me that, since the May nonlinear break,
this portfolio had a return advantage of positive 5.44 percent over its

benchmark. This is just one illustration of the power of the concepts that
we’ve discussed in this book.

Timeframe diversiﬁcation evolves from the recognition that neither in-
dividual securities nor individual markets—such as the S&P 500 or 100,
Dow, Russell 1000, 2000, or 3000—always move in a single direction. Even
if a market is in a long-term trend, there will be meaningful countertrends,
which we refer to as intermediate-term auctions. These countertrend auc-
tions can easily retrace 5 percent to 10 percent of the trend, and can ac-
tually be healthy developments in that they enable markets to come into
balance in order to prepare for the next signiﬁcant leg of the trend. There
is also general agreement that not all sectors, industries, or individual se-
curities advance or decline together. In fact, it is more common to see
contrary movement or rotations. Because diversiﬁcation among industries,
sectors, and individual securities is widely accepted and encouraged, is
it such a reach to accept that portfolios should also be diversiﬁed by be-
ing short securities or markets that are likely to diverge? The State Street
example provided a real-life illustration of this concept: 5.44 percent pos-
itive difference for a portfolio of approximately half a billion dollars is
real money.

While we believe that investors who rely on fundamental information
as the basis for their investment decisions can and do make money over
the long run, we don’t believe that fundamental information alone can ever
guarantee an absolute proﬁt or even a relative advantage over competitors.
At the time fundamental investors place their trades, they have no way of
knowing how much, if any, of that fundamental information has already
been incorporated into the price they paid or received. That is the Achilles’
heel that is exposed when one relies solely on fundamental information.

Consider that the forces that push a security away from fundamental
value tend to be behavioral in nature, particularly at the end of extreme
moves when the risk of price movement is greatest. The further behavioral
forces drive the price of a security, the more interested the fundamental-
ists get, as they base their decisions (at least in the abstract) on perceived
value. When prices have been driven too low, for example, aggressive value
buyers appear. Extreme examples would include buyouts, mergers, and
spin-offs. In these types of occurrences, timeframe diversiﬁcation would
include lightening up on hedges placed when the security was too high.
These hedges might include raising cash, moving into defensive securities,
selling options on either indexes or individual portfolio securities, buying
index puts on the overall market, industries or sectors, and so on.

The point here is that just as there is fundamental information, there
is also behavioral information. Fundamentalists forecast, but there is lit-
tle evidence that suggests there’s any merit to their augury. So why not
combine the analytical power of fundamental information with a real-time

understanding of market activity, employing intermediate timeframe diver-
siﬁcation in order to secure a competitive edge?

Fundamental information reﬂects (or is an estimate of, based on
all known contributing factors) the core long-term value of a secu-
rity. Shorter-term behavioral forces can drive price away from this fun-
damental value—often times far away. The challenge for fundamental
investors—and most professional asset managers fall into this camp—is
determining whether behavioral or fundamental forces are driving the
price of a security, to what extent, and what (if anything) can be done
to protect or improve their portfolio proﬁtability. That is precisely where
market-generated information and the concepts presented in this book be-
come invaluable.

THE NEW PARADIGM

This new paradigm claims that the prices of secu-
rities are not always the best estimate of the true
underlying value of the ﬁrm. It argues that prices
can be inﬂuenced by speculators and momentum
traders, as well as by insiders and institutions that
often buy and sell stocks for reasons unrelated to
fundamental value, such as for diversiﬁcation, liq-
uidity and taxes. In other words, prices of secu-
rities are subject to temporary shocks that I call
“noise” that obscures their true value. These tem-
porary shocks may last for days or for years, and
their unpredictability makes it difﬁcult to design
a trading strategy that consistently produces supe-
rior returns.

—Jeremy Siegel

When a professor of Wharton Business School is trumpeting the “new
paradigm,” the world stands waiting for a new theory. Siegel states that it
is difﬁcult to build a “strategy” because of the unpredictability inherent in
market activity. Markets in Proﬁle puts forth just such a strategy, based
on a continual reevaluation of the risk of being long or short in any given
market.

We have explored two themes: market understanding and self-
understanding. We have campaigned for what we believe to be a more
consistently reliable, objective source of information—the market itself.
Using the market proﬁle conforms to the way our brains receive and

process information. We have offered suggestions and sources to help you
hone your own process of self-understanding, emphasizing the importance
of unlearning old habits in order to clear your mind, so you can assimilate
market-generated information in the present tense.

It’s a simple thing to say, “Clear your mind.” It’s quite another to
put into practice. Giving up an idea that you have clung to for a long
time can be extremely painful, and it is labor intensive to replace it with
another—especially one that lacks clear, easily parsed directives. You have
to be secure in yourself to let go of the status quo; secure people have con-
ﬁdence that they will assimilate new information and processes and get
back on an even keel.

The key to unraveling the ﬂux of market-generated information, as un-
derstood from the context of your own evolving emotional and cognitive
makeup, is to accept the fact that all decisions are made under some de-
gree of uncertainty. That is the fundamental nature of humanity.

Nothing is certain. The agile mind, however, when properly trained and
prepared, can discern in the elegant array of evolving market-generated
information occasional patterns—like oases of opportunity—that enable
the execution of trades that offer greater reward with diminished risk. That
beats average any day.

Market Update

I n Chapter 6, we discussed how markets rarely go from bull to bear

or from bear to bull, but rather transition from bull or bear to brack-
eting. Once the bracketing process is complete, markets either return
to the previously established trend or begin a new auction in the opposite
direction.

In latter chapters, we showed you a market that began to break hard
in May 2006 (which was occurring as we were writing that portion of the
book). Our explication was bold, as the low hadn’t been established and
we had only the theories expounded in this book to guide us. Because we
were writing about real-time market activity, we promised that we would
provide an update on how the market played out when we completed the
book. Today is October 23, 2006—two days before we submit the ﬁnal ed-
its to our publisher. So far, using the December 2006 S&P 500 futures chart
(shown in Figure A.1), the market’s high in May 2006 was 1353 with a low
of 1239 on June 14, and a recovery high of 1380 on October 18. The process
may not be complete; however, from the market low the recovery has re-
traced 100 percent of the break that began in May and has begun to auction
higher.

As you may recall, we also stated that the initial break was not unex-
pected, because the rally to the new highs in May 2006 were made on ex-
tremely light volume. Toward the end of the summer once “proof” that the
market was weak had arrived, numerous portfolio managers on the talk-
show circuit began to turn bearish—well after the lows were established
and far too late to provide a competitive advantage.

tures.

There is a better way to understand and read markets. Long-term in-
vestors and traders armed with market-generated information and the in-
sight provided by the concepts, techniques, and high-probability indicators
discussed in this book will be better prepared to act before the herd has
turned, positioning themselves favorably in the ever-changing market.

About the Authors

JIM DALTON

After spending several years trading and mentoring traders, Jim was asked
to return to UBS Financial Services in 2001 to direct and reorganize its non-
proprietary hedge fund research. This opportunity greatly expanded his ex-
posure to many of the world’s most successful traders and their strategies.
Jim then retired in August 2005 after having held the titles of manager,
Hedge Fund Research, and director of research for managed accounts. He
currently trades for his own account and is the lead author of Markets in
Proﬁle. His earlier book, Mind Over Markets (by the same authors), was
originally published in 1990 and continues to be popular among profes-
sional traders, providing a wealth of tactical trading strategies based on
the Market Proﬁle. The book was recently translated into Chinese.

Jim has been a member of both the CBOT and CBOE, and he served
as executive vice president of the CBOE during its early formative years.
Additional experience includes four years active duty in the Marine Corp.
and several years with IBM and Merrill Lynch. From his experience, he
has learned that “expert opinion” rarely pans out in the active market.
He has also observed that superior trading results over the longer term are
always the result of a more ﬂexible, adaptive approach to markets. These
observations set the stage for Jim’s introduction to the Market Proﬁle, a
method of arranging data that enables the visualization of evolving market
structure.

ROBERT BEVAN DALTON

After a brief stint as assistant editor of a small-town Midwestern newspa-
per, Rob pursued a hodgepodge of endeavors, from wandering the Mid-
dle East to crafting hardwood ﬂoors in Tucson and playing at rock star

in Greenwich Village. He returned to the written word in the guise of a
PR hack for various fashion agencies in Manhattan before ﬂeeing the East
Coast for sunny Seattle, where he founded Jie23, a new media design ﬁrm.
He is now a freelance writer living in the woods on Bainbridge Island with
his wife and two young boys. When he’s not servicing clients like Microsoft,
Vail, Holland America, and British Airways, he crafts the occasional poem
and writes for a strange m«elange of start-ups, creative collaboratives, and
arts and environmental nonproﬁts. Not to mention the occasional book on
neuroeconomics.

ERIC JONES

Eric Jones began his career around markets, investing and trading while
working as a foreign exchange analyst at a small commodity research and
investment management ﬁrm founded by his father. It was there that he
developed an appreciation for the power of quantitative trading systems.
Also while there he met Jim Dalton, who introduced him to the Market
Proﬁle, the concept of market-generated information and the tremendously
expanded potential of organizing data according to price, time, and volume,
instead of just price alone, as was traditionally done.

On and off over the years, Jim and Eric have worked together in vari-
ous capacities: as partners in a futures market research and trading ﬁrm, as
investment advisors to clients, as developers of new investment products
and platforms, and as leaders of investment research teams. Most recently,
Eric was senior vice president, director of product development and invest-
ment manager research for UBS Financial Services’ Advisory and Consult-
ing Solutions, a unit comprised of managed account, alternative investment
and fee-based brokerage products. In this role, Eric was responsible for the
strategic development, integration, and market positioning of managed ac-
count and alternative investment products and platforms.

In addition to Mind Over Markets and Markets in Proﬁle, Eric is also
coauthor of Hedging Foreign Exchange, Converting Risk to Proﬁt (Wiley,
1986).
