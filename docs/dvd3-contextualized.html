<p>Figure out who's dominating the market. The day timeframe trader, they will buy yesterday's high, they'll sell yesterday's low. The long timeframe or longer timeframe, they could care less. So you start very quickly to understand who's dominating the market today, who's dominating the market, starts to help you identify what your opportunities are.</p>
<p><h3>[0:30 - 1:00] `frame_0002.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So you start very quickly to understand who's dominating the market today, who's dominating the market, starts to help you identify what your opportunities are. Day timeframe control opens at the edge of the previous day's range, looks beyond the extreme but is contained. So there's the open, the market comes back to one tick above the open. That's all there is to it. This could have been a bigger, this could have been bigger early on, right? What kind of an opening did I have? I had an open and drive. Okay, open and drive. I went one tick out of balance. Open and drive. It could have been a big day. I don't know early on.</p>
<p><h3>[1:00 - 1:30] `frame_0003.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>This could have been a bigger, this could have been bigger early on, right? What kind of an opening did I have? I had an open and drive. Okay, open and drive. I went one tick out of balance. Open and drive. It could have been a big day. I don't know early on. When I see this, I want to immediately get what? I want to get long immediately. Okay, I get long and I measure, I monitor the trade for what? Continuation. As the day goes on, I get back up to the point of control. Remember, it's hard to get away from it. But I start to get no elongation. Okay?</p>
<p><h3>[1:30 - 2:00] `frame_0004.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>As the day goes on, I get back up to the point of control. Remember, it's hard to get away from it. But I start to get no elongation. Okay? When I can't get by this, do I see, do you see any evidence that there is any timeframe other than the daytime frame on the buy side of this market? Longer timeframe. They go through that like a shot. They got back up to everything. Really good traders know where the fairest price or the point of control was from yesterday. Where did most of the volume take place yesterday? At the point of control. Really good short-term traders, they know that.</p>
<p><h3>[2:00 - 2:30] `frame_0005.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Where did most of the volume take place yesterday? At the point of control. Really good short-term traders, they know that. They automatically know that. And if they didn't write the price down, they just remember it. So we got up there, there wasn't anything there. So now, the market comes down. We didn't take out the morning. We got to the morning opening exactly and rotated back up. Who do you think is in control of this day? It's all day. It's all day timeframe trading. Now, if you're sitting there trying to make a big trade out of this or trying to find the big trade, guess what?</p>
<p><h3>[2:30 - 3:00] `frame_0006.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It's all day. It's all day timeframe trading. Now, if you're sitting there trying to make a big trade out of this or trying to find the big trade, guess what? You're going to get whipped around. You're going to get the whipsaw. You're going to be very disappointed. It's just not there. So this idea of understanding the behavior of the different timeframes and understanding what timeframe is in control is extremely important. Okay. Other than day timeframe control, prices open in range but move quickly out. So when that starts to happen, you have an indication that if I open within yesterday's range and I start to move pretty quickly and pretty aggressively out of yesterday's range,</p>
<p><h3>[3:00 - 3:30] `frame_0007.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So when that starts to happen, you have an indication that if I open within yesterday's range and I start to move pretty quickly and pretty aggressively out of yesterday's range, is the day timeframe in control? Probably not. At a minimum, it would be what timeframe? Be the short timeframe or the next longest timeframe in there. It may be, and I don't want to confuse it. Every timeframe has some business to do every day. We are only talking about who is really dominating the market on a particular day.</p>
<p><h3>[3:30 - 4:00] `frame_0008.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>Every timeframe has some business to do every day. We are only talking about who is really dominating the market on a particular day. Okay. So you get in this. Also, you can look and see what the value and you just start to get some aggression to the upside by a longer timeframe. Look at the highs. Do you have a good high up there? And what we define a good high as at least having some kind of selling tail. Okay. When you don't have a good high, I call it a poor high or unsecure. Unsecure is probably not going to be lasting or at least the odds of it being lasting aren't good.</p>
<p><h3>[4:00 - 4:30] `frame_0009.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Okay. When you don't have a good high, I call it a poor high or unsecure. Unsecure is probably not going to be lasting or at least the odds of it being lasting aren't good. Remember, it's not quite that simple. It may be because the market's too long, but for our, we have to learn to walk before we get, you know, more advanced. But if I have, if I have that poor high up there, do I have any evidence that the next longer timeframe came in to start to take advantage of higher prices and sell the market down?</p>
<p><h3>[4:30 - 5:00] `frame_0010.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But if I have, if I have that poor high up there, do I have any evidence that the next longer timeframe came in to start to take advantage of higher prices and sell the market down? Weren't there, right? They may have been subtly selling something, but they weren't aggressively selling anything. Those are the clues by organizing the data that's revealed in the structure. If I had a single bar chart, a one dimensional bar chart, think of all the information that I would not be privy to.</p>
<p><h3>[5:00 - 5:30] `frame_0011.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I wouldn't see the depth. I wouldn't of the market. I wouldn't see the dynamics that are there. Okay. Let's go on. Aha. The diffusion model. Years ago, I used, when I did some lectures years ago, and I'd say to people, let me talk a little bit about the behavior of people. If I had a perfect idea, and I offered that perfect idea to five people in this room, and it was guaranteed that idea was going to make, could make $500 if you bought it today.</p>
<p><h3>[5:30 - 6:00] `frame_0012.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If I had a perfect idea, and I offered that perfect idea to five people in this room, and it was guaranteed that idea was going to make, could make $500 if you bought it today. Would all five people buy it right now? More than likely not. I get one person that's still buying, and then it starts to move up a little bit. It's working. Then I get somebody else comes along, and they buy it, right? And of course, the more evidence that it's working, the more people that are willing to buy it. And finally, the fifth person in the room at the very top can't stand it anymore, and they buy it, right?</p>
<p><h3>[6:00 - 6:30] `frame_0013.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And finally, the fifth person in the room at the very top can't stand it anymore, and they buy it, right? Does that go on in markets? Has it happened to us? Of course it has. So I used to use that for a long time. Then this guy, Malcolm Gladwell came along, and I forget which book this was in. Was this in The Tipping Point or Blink? Tipping Point. Tipping Point. And what he did was he gave it a name, and he put numbers behind it, which people love, right?</p>
<p><h3>[6:30 - 7:00] `frame_0014.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>THE DIFFUSION MODEL</blockquote>
<blockquote>FPVwr</blockquote>
<blockquote>INNOVATORS</blockquote>
<blockquote>EARLY ADOPTERS</blockquote>
<blockquote>EARLY MAJORITY</blockquote>
<blockquote>LATE MAJORITY</blockquote>
<blockquote>LAGGARDS</blockquote></p>
<p>And what he did was he gave it a name, and he put numbers behind it, which people love, right? They love a label, and one, two, three, four, five, and give each one a label. Incidentally, Gladwell's got about four books out there. They are wonderful, wonderful reads. He is one of the best I've ever known that has the ability to go out. And he really takes other people's research, and he packages in a very, very wonderful way. It's The Tipping Point. It's Blink. The newest one is What the Dogs Saw. But they're great for understanding the markets and people. The diffusion model is talking about here.</p>
<p><h3>[7:00 - 7:30] `frame_0015.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The diffusion model is talking about here. It's the same thing I talked about for years. You just put a label. The innovator. The innovator is the first person in. Okay? So, when I was a kid, they had, that's all I really know when I was a kid was the Airstream. You know, they were the innovators. Before we go here, and incidentally, innovators usually are not corporations and big organizations. Big organizations make decisions how?</p>
<p><h2>Section 2: Big organizations make decisions how?</h2></p>
<p><h3>[7:30 - 8:00] `frame_0016.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Big organizations make decisions how? Through committees, right? Committees don't take big risks. I was one of them for a number of years. Innovators. Innovators are normally individuals. Pretty independent. Think about the name you hear a lot about the mortgage business. You hear about this guy Paulson. Made a billion dollars for himself, and I forget how many billion for, you know, the clients of his hedge fund. It was his own hedge fund. He called the shots, right? He was the guy that was short the mortgage market.</p>
<p><h3>[8:00 - 8:30] `frame_0017.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>He was the guy that was short the mortgage market. And some of these, one of these new great books written by the guy, Michael Lewis, that wrote The Blind Side. The Big Short. It's a great book. But, you know, he was the innovator. He got involved in shorting the mortgage market and made a lot of money. So the innovator is early, early to the party, usually fairly independent, usually very smart. Some risk. Sometimes they're wrong. There are, there's a firm no longer exists anymore, Bear Stearns.</p>
<p><h3>[8:30 - 9:00] `frame_0018.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>There are, there's a firm no longer exists anymore, Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns for years never wanted to be the innovator. What they would do is they would wait until somebody else was in and had a good idea. Then they would come along and they wanted to be what Gladwell would call the early adopter. After they saw there was some risk taken out of it, big manufacturing companies, drug companies, they go along and they buy people that are already underway. So you get the innovator. Then you get the early adopter. And we walked, we walked through this and just kind of taking a look at the, what's going on in the, in the recreational vehicle market.</p>
<p><h3>[9:00 - 9:30] `frame_0019.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And we walked, we walked through this and just kind of taking a look at the, what's going on in the, in the recreational vehicle market. And one of the things, you've got the innovators, the early adopters, they enter the market, they identify that change is underway. And where did a lot of this take place? Um, let's go, let's go. Let's look at the, uh, at the next, no, the first, second, third, late majority.</p>
<p><h3>[9:30 - 10:00] `frame_0020.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Let's look at the, uh, at the next, no, the first, second, third, late majority. A lot of this real growth happened following 9-11. Okay. Following 9-11 for people vacation. What did they, what were they feeling about airplane traffic? Air, traveling by plane. They weren't as comfortable, right? So people kind of changed, changed how they did things. They changed, they changed, um, their vacation.</p>
<p><h3>[10:00 - 10:30] `frame_0021.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>COMMODITY OR MARKET</blockquote>
<blockquote>BEING AUCTIONED, THIS</blockquote>
<blockquote>ILLUSTRATION OF HUMAN</blockquote>
<blockquote>BEHAVIOR CONSISTENTLY</blockquote>
<blockquote>PLAYS OUT IN VIRTUALLY</blockquote>
<blockquote>EVERY AUCTION</blockquote></p>
<p>They changed, they changed, um, their vacation. We got in and we got more mobile homes, uh, more, uh, recreational vehicles, more manufacturers, more people in the party. So we had the innovator been around for a long time. You know, the, the, the Airstream. Uh, and we see this in the market all the time. Everybody knows, everybody knows what it's all about, right? And they're, everybody's coming in, they're buying every break. And I just love this. I live, I live in, uh, Prescott, Arizona.</p>
<p><h3>[10:30 - 11:00] `frame_0022.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I live, I live in, uh, Prescott, Arizona. So I live out west. You actually have places that look like this out west. Where you just look over the tops of these, uh, of these things. Matter of fact, we have the innovator. Okay. Follow the innovator. We have, which would really be two, the early adopters. These are still intelligent people, but they let it get underway first. They get on the trend fairly early. Okay. So when they get on, the buying tail's already gone, right? The buying tail is the, uh, is the innovator.</p>
<p><h3>[11:00 - 11:30] `frame_0023.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The buying tail is the, uh, is the innovator. The early adopter is when you're starting to get the structure is forming a little bit. Then you go on and you get the early majority would be three. The late majority would be four. And we saw our late majority. Everybody's in almost, right? We got almost everybody in. And then you finally get to the final stage, which is stage five, where you get the laggards. And you see this all the time in markets, right? I mean, think about this behavior.</p>
<p><h3>[11:30 - 12:00] `frame_0024.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I mean, think about this behavior. All of a sudden, you know, they know you cannot do anything but own the market. And when you look at this, you see the years, um, you see the growth. And then you see what happens to the laggards. They're almost always late to the party. Um, when you look at a market, let's say, let's say this market. Say you got a market that's going up. When the tie is finally made, you got the laggard, the final laggard short covers.</p>
<p><h3>[12:00 - 12:30] `frame_0025.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>When the tie is finally made, you got the laggard, the final laggard short covers. So you got a market that's going up. The final stage, you get the laggard shorts that are covering. Combined with the laggard longs that never got on board. So you got two laggards up there. Met by, and who meets those people? The innovator. The innovators meet those people. So when the mortgage market was going down, when the mortgage market was, was going, was,</p>
<p><h3>[12:30 - 13:00] `frame_0026.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So when the mortgage market was going down, when the mortgage market was, was going, was, when the mortgage market was at its peak to be shorted. Okay. And you had these people flipping homes. Uh, my sister lives in Naples, Florida. One of the women down there, you know, had 50 homes she was owning, trying to flip. Can't understand why she went bankrupt. Okay. Who came in? Paulson came in as the innovator shorting the mortgage market. So it's understanding, understanding that is part of behavior, how we operate.</p>
<p><h3>[13:00 - 13:30] `frame_0027.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So it's understanding, understanding that is part of behavior, how we operate. We see it in the daytime frame. We see it in the short timeframe. We see it in the intermediate timeframe. We see it in the long timeframe. When the market broke in 08, the market was off substantially. Uh, it was getting weaker, getting weaker, getting weaker. It was off substantially before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, because the thing was just coming apart. Then the volume for the last part of the market was huge, because guess what?</p>
<p><h3>[13:30 - 14:00] `frame_0028.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>

<p>Then the volume for the last part of the market was huge, because guess what? The longest timeframes were now liquidating the market. The longest timeframes were the final laggards that took the market. And then after they were done, with huge volume, after they were done, the market moved back up from March of last year until just recently. So that process goes on for all timeframes within the market.</p>
<p><h3>[14:00 - 14:30] `frame_0029.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So that process goes on for all timeframes within the market. But I did a, uh, I did a webinar for, uh, uh, Linda Ratzky one time. And I was trying to convey the emotions that we go through as traders in the marketplace. And what I'm thinking about is the pari-mutual betting. And let's assume, let's assume that instead of closing the board, we leave the board open. And we leave the tote board open until, uh, just a couple of seconds before the final horse</p>
<p><h3>[14:30 - 15:00] `frame_0030.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And we leave the tote board open until, uh, just a couple of seconds before the final horse crosses the, uh, crosses the line. Okay. As you're watching the, as you're watching the race and it becomes clearer and clearer who the winner is going to be. If the, if the, you can still bet, where is all the money going to be? It's going, it's going to the leader, right? And how much thought you get so wrapped up in this auction process. How much thought do you think you're going to give to what the payoff is?</p>
<p><h3>[15:00 - 15:30] `frame_0031.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>How much thought do you think you're going to give to what the payoff is? There it goes. You can place your bet at any time. And of course, you're coming into the far turn up by six and a half lengths. They're widening the length. There's nobody coming from behind. You can still bet how much money is going into the betting pool. Okay. How do we determine the payout? By the amount of the what? Money bets. The amount of the pool, right? What do you think the winnings are good for every $2?</p>
<p><h3>[15:30 - 16:00] `frame_0032.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>What do you think the winnings are good for every $2? You're going to get what about $2 and a penny. Now think about the risk. Your five, your five lengths from the finish line. Horse stumbles. You could have made a penny and you lose it all, right? But guess what? People get so caught up in the auction process. They get so caught up in this diffusion model and how people, how they act and their behavior that they forget all about the risk they're taking and what the payoff is going to be.</p>
<p><h2>Section 3: They get so caught up in this diffusion model and how</h2></p>
<p><h3>[16:00 - 16:30] `frame_0033.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They get so caught up in this diffusion model and how people, how they act and their behavior that they forget all about the risk they're taking and what the payoff is going to be. That is not made in jest. That happens in the markets every day. So I just want to throw that as an example. I want you to think about the diffusion model. And then of course when you, one day you wake up and you bought the high for the day or you sold the low for the day and you say, oh my golly, I'm a ligard. You know, it's really probably not something you're going down to the local pump to brag about.</p>
<p><h3>[16:30 - 17:00] `frame_0034.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You know, it's really probably not something you're going down to the local pump to brag about. But anybody that's traded for any period of time has been there. Um, it's human, this human behavior plays out continually. There are two well known names in the educational world. Amos Tversky has passed on. Daniel Kahneman is still teaching at Princeton. They won the Nobel Prize in economics for what they labeled.</p>
<p><h3>[17:00 - 17:30] `frame_0035.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>They won the Nobel Prize in economics for what they labeled. Um, I'm forgetting the, I'm forgetting the name of what they, prospect theory, what they called prospect theory. Ask Kahneman one time, how'd you come up with that name? Oh, it means nothing. We're just trying to get people's attention. What the research showed was that markets are irrational. Surprise, surprise. However, the markets are irrational in a predictable manner.</p>
<p><h3>[17:30 - 18:00] `frame_0036.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>However, the markets are irrational in a predictable manner. Think about the power of that. Where do you, when we talk about the diffusion model and we talk about the pari mutual board and everything else, and we talk about, you know, getting trapped where we buy the high or sell the low. Uh, was it rational? No, but it certainly was predictable because that's the human behavior. That's what people do. The better you understand that, the better you understand that, the better you can fend off getting trapped into the same process emotionally yourself.</p>
<p><h3>[18:00 - 18:30] `frame_0037.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The better you understand that, the better you understand that, the better you can fend off getting trapped into the same process emotionally yourself. And this happens no matter how experienced the trader is. You will from time to time fall into these traps. One of the, the most important things you can do in order to prepare for any day is identify references. Some of these references will be daytime frame references. Some will be short time frame. And short time frame reference would be defined as what? Three to five. Three to five days. Intermediate term references and long term references.</p>
<p><h3>[18:30 - 19:00] `frame_0038.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Intermediate term references and long term references. So you can categorize the references. All I want to do is kind of whet your appetite to them and let's kind of look at a list of some of the reference, um, that we're, that we're talking about. Um, some are fairly easy. The prior session, high or low. Okay. Another one that you may not be as familiar with is the overnight trading.</p>
<p><h3>[19:00 - 19:30] `frame_0039.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Another one that you may not be as familiar with is the overnight trading. The most of these markets trade overnight in the electronic market. The overnight high and low are significant reference points. I don't pay much attention to anything else overnight. I do pay attention to the overnight high and to the overnight low. Uh, there's some other things that are, um, involved. I'm not going to go into those right now. Um, I look at the close or what is called unchanged.</p>
<p><h3>[19:30 - 20:00] `frame_0040.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Um, I look at the close or what is called unchanged. There's not a short term trader in the world that doesn't know what unchanged is. Um, which would be last night's close. POC. Another word for POC is what? Fairest price to? To conduct business. The rally high or pull back low. Early this morning, we had a trend day going up late in the afternoon. One of our references was the pull back low. Okay. If the market was going in the opposite direction, the market was breaking, trend day breaking, and then you had a rally high.</p>
<p><h3>[20:00 - 20:30] `frame_0041.jpg`</h3></p>

<blockquote>FGKL</blockquote></p>
<p>If the market was going in the opposite direction, the market was breaking, trend day breaking, and then you had a rally high. That rally high would also be a reference. One of the reasons we use references, because if change is going to take place, change is more than likely going to take place relative to a reference. Trading, incidentally, is about change. Without change, without change, there's no opportunity. The question now, we're looking at how big is the change? Or what could it be?</p>
<p><h3>[20:30 - 21:00] `frame_0042.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Or what could it be? So, we've got the rally high or low. We've got bracket highs or lows. And incidentally, I'll confuse everybody tremendously, because I use interchangeably. Trading range higher lows, bracket higher lows, they're all the same thing. I generally think of trading ranges as being smaller. So, let's say you've got a 10-day balance back and forth. And I tend to think of brackets as being, you know, several weeks or longer. But I interchange the two.</p>
<p><h3>[21:00 - 21:30] `frame_0043.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But I interchange the two. But looking from the top of a balance area to the bottom of a balance area. So, if you've got a 10-day range from the top to the bottom, would be that trading range or bracket high or low. Spikes, we haven't talked about spikes yet. We will talk about spikes. They happen late in the day. And we'll talk about those in a second. The current session opening price, where today's market opens, becomes a daytime frame reference.</p>
<p><h3>[21:30 - 22:00] `frame_0044.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>The current session opening price, where today's market opens, becomes a daytime frame reference. And important, particularly on those days when the market is controlled by the daytime frame or short-term traders. Half back. So, if a market has a range of, say, 1 to 10 in the morning, 5 would be half back or someplace in between 5 and 6 would be half back. On a day when the market is being controlled by short-time frame traders, you'll find that half back becomes a very important reference. And it sounds kind of crazy, but it's kind of the way the world works out there.</p>
<p><h3>[22:00 - 22:30] `frame_0045.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And it sounds kind of crazy, but it's kind of the way the world works out there. Double distribution ranges. You saw a double distribution trend day early this morning. And I said the lower and the upper distribution traded as separate days. But also, the bottom of each of those distributions, the top of each distributions, and the single prints that separate the two distributions. Those are all ranges. Then we have longer term references. And they come from the daily charts, from the weekly charts, and from the monthly charts.</p>
<p><h3>[22:30 - 23:00] `frame_0046.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And they come from the daily charts, from the weekly charts, and from the monthly charts. So, there's a tremendous amount of work that you go through in order to identify references. The longer the reference, the longer the reference, the more likely the change is going to be initiated by a longer time frame. And the more likely the change is going to be relatively significant. Can we go to CQG for just a minute and look at gold?</p>
<p><h3>[23:00 - 23:30] `frame_0047.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Can we go to CQG for just a minute and look at gold? Sure. I'm told that I was looking at gold the other day. And one of the reasons I was looking at gold was because there's a lot of momentum trading going on in the market. Momentum traders trade a lot of gold. They trade a lot of crude oil. They trade a lot of stocks. They don't trade a lot of treasury bonds. So, there's just certain kind of markets that the momentum traders like. One of the markets that they like a lot is gold. If you will hit comma M on there. Go to bar chart.</p>

<p>Go to bar chart. Go to bar chart. And if you look at bar chart. Okay. Now we're looking at the daily. No, we're looking at the monthly. We're looking at the monthly chart for gold. Okay. Come across the old high. If I looked at that reference off of a monthly chart, would I call that a day time frame? No. Would I call it a short time frame reference? No. Would I call it a short time frame reference? No. Would I call it an intermediate time frame reference?</p>
<p><h3>[24:00 - 24:30] `frame_0049.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Would I call it an intermediate time frame reference? No. I would call it a long time frame reference. What time frame is responsible for breaking a market out into new territory? If you're at a market high, what time frame is responsible for breaking it into new ground? The long time frame, right? Okay. Now, what did we have go on today in gold? Gold is up, what, 2280? Gold's up 2280? We had a breakout.</p>
<p><h2>Section 4: We had a breakout</h2></p>
<p><h3>[24:30 - 25:00] `frame_0050.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We had a breakout. We had a long, that reference. And we were talking about gold the other day. We had that reference. So, we had an upside breakout in the longest time frame with gold. That's how we would use that reference. Now, again, I talk about, we're not about mechanical trades, but there are some trades that you must do. When you have a market that comes out of one of those ranges or out of a balance area, you've got to put your orders in. You've got to go with those trades. If you're, in fact, going to be a trader and you're going to be successful over a long period of time.</p>
<p><h3>[25:00 - 25:30] `frame_0051.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If you're, in fact, going to be a trader and you're going to be successful over a long period of time. When you break out of a market like that, we're up 2280. Okay? Now, think of the mentality, and I referred to this earlier. Some people would say, oh my golly, I can't buy gold here. The risk is too high. I'm not buying gold at new highs. Okay? And I'm sitting there saying, there's actually less risk once it's broken out. On the side before you break out, the risk is heavy.</p>
<p><h3>[25:30 - 26:00] `frame_0052.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>On the side before you break out, the risk is heavy. Once you break out, the risk is light. Forget the price. Once it's broke out, it's into new ground. It's into new ground. You've got new players, new ball game. You need to go with that. You need to go with that trade. There's actually less risk buying the breakout today than there was buying it before we broke out. Before it breaks out, it may not make it, and the traders may come in and slam it down. Once it gets into new ground, guess what?</p>
<p><h3>[26:00 - 26:30] `frame_0053.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Once it gets into new ground, guess what? Are they going to be bidding or offering? You go into new ground, they're bidding. And when you have a market that is well bid, you don't have any risk. As long as there's bidders in there, you don't have any risk. For example, the auctioneer, you hear the auctioneer say, I have 93, I have 94, I have 95, 97. 97, new bidder. Okay? When that process is going on, guess what? We're going higher. That auction's not over. Anyhow, let's go back to the references. I just, we have been following gold. We've been working on references.</p>
<p><h3>[26:30 - 27:00] `frame_0054.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We've been working on references. And I wanted to show you one in real time that broke out, broke out today. Reference, one of the nice things about references. We talked earlier and we said there's a tremendous correlation between performance and preparation. And we see that in any kind of skill-based activity. Whether it be sports, whether it be music, or any, or anything else. So there is that kind of thing. You can prepare, you can prepare for the references before the market opens, right?</p>
<p><h3>[27:00 - 27:30] `frame_0055.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>You can prepare, you can prepare for the references before the market opens, right? You have the ability to do that in preparation for today's trading. If you aren't prepared, and you're trying to do this once the market opens, the chances of being successful are very small. You're trying to focus on the market, you're trying to see where in balance, out of balance. You're not prepared. This is something you can always do ahead of time.</p>
<p><h3>[27:30 - 28:00] `frame_0056.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>This is something you can always do ahead of time. Okay? Let's take a look. Day timeframe references. We said earlier, that's what they look like. The overnight, high or low. So, the open. The open is always a daytime frame reference. Everybody, every short-term trader knows where the market opens. And they're looking to see are we going up or down from the open. We've already talked about the point of control. Okay? Now just one more thing on the point of control. Fairest price to do business.</p>
<p><h3>[28:00 - 28:30] `frame_0057.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Fairest price to do business. The more prominent, meaning reading from left to right, the more prominent the point of control is, the higher the odds that we will regress back to that price at some later date. For example, we saw this before, but look up here. The market opened. We went within one tick of the point of control, or the fairest price. It's hard to get away from it. Another reference that we talked earlier about half-back, right? Another reference.</p>
<p><h3>[28:30 - 29:00] `frame_0058.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Another reference. There's another reference. The pull-back low. We've seen before. A close. Those are all daytime frame references. Okay? So, if you label them, and what I'm suggesting to now, and I just thought about this a few days ago. Instead of just, we used to just put in references. Now I'm suggesting, not only do you put in the reference, but if it's half-back, just put in daytime frame reference. You remind yourself, it's a daytime frame reference.</p>
<p><h3>[29:00 - 29:30] `frame_0059.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You remind yourself, it's a daytime frame reference. Okay? The shorter the time frame, the less significant the reference is going to be. If you're the shorter term trader, it's going to be very significant. If you're a long-term trader, you could care less about the daytime frame references. A lot of times, they refer to those as noise. Okay? Let's take a look and go a step further. More daytime frame trade. Excess. A buying tail, or a selling tail, has another name for it.</p>
<p><h3>[29:30 - 30:00] `frame_0060.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>A buying tail, or a selling tail, has another name for it. It's called excess. So, when a market goes too high, let's say we see a market that runs up, it goes too high, and sells off quickly. It was the end of the auction. We call that excess. Excess is one of the two most important concepts you will ever deal with in what we're talking about. Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction. And is it daytime frame excess? Excess? Is it long time frame excess?</p>
<p><h3>[30:00 - 30:30] `frame_0061.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Is it long time frame excess? We'll talk more about it, but excess is important in all time frames. We talked about double distribution ranges. Single print ranges. Excess on the bottom. So, we just keep working through this idea of daytime frame references. Let's go on and see what more daytime frame references are. The spike. Okay? When we're talking here, this late break, and usually the spike is actually bigger than that.</p>
<p><h3>[30:30 - 31:00] `frame_0062.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>When we're talking here, this late break, and usually the spike is actually bigger than that. The definition of a spike. A spike is something that happens late in the day. Either on the upside or the downside. Relatively close to the close. And it is another way to think of a spike. It's a probe. A market either probing higher or probing lower. Okay? And we call it a spike. It happens late in the day. And a lot of times, there's not enough time left to know if it was a valid probe.</p>
<p><h3>[31:00 - 31:30] `frame_0063.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And a lot of times, there's not enough time left to know if it was a valid probe. In other words, was it a price probe that was accepted or was it a price probe that was rejected? If the probe is to the downside, for example, then the top of the spike, the top of the spike, would be what traditionally would be referred to as resistance. If it's to the upside, the bottom of the spike would be called support. Again, there's short-term references in there. What we're looking for the following morning, to see if that price probe was accepted or rejected.</p>
<p><h3>[31:30 - 32:00] `frame_0064.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>What we're looking for the following morning, to see if that price probe was accepted or rejected. If the market is auctioning higher and we have a late price probe to the upside, the market is looking for what? It's looking for sellers, right? So the question is, did the market go high enough to look for the sellers that it was attempting to find? So if we open below the spike the following morning, we have excess and the market went high enough to find the sellers that it was searching for.</p>
<p><h3>[32:00 - 32:30] `frame_0065.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So if we open below the spike the following morning, we have excess and the market went high enough to find the sellers that it was searching for. If we open within the spike, the market did a pretty good job of finding acceptance. It went to the level where they found sellers. Some two-sided trade can take place. If we open above the spike, the market didn't go high enough to attract the sellers it was looking for late in the previous day. Also, we may start looking now at a three-day balance. So here we have a three-day trading range and we're going to have the high and the low of that three-day trading range.</p>
<p><h3>[32:30 - 33:00] `frame_0066.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So here we have a three-day trading range and we're going to have the high and the low of that three-day trading range. It becomes a reference. Okay, the high and the low of the three-day trading range. Is it a day timeframe reference or is it a short-term reference? It's a short-term reference. And remember, short-term timeframe is three to five days, maybe a little longer. So start labeling as a short-term reference. A short-term reference is going to have more significance than is a day timeframe reference. So if you break out of a three-day balance, okay, it's broken out not by the day timeframe trade.</p>
<p><h2>Section 5: So if you break out of a three-day balance, okay, it's</h2></p>
<p><h3>[33:00 - 33:30] `frame_0067.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So if you break out of a three-day balance, okay, it's broken out not by the day timeframe trade. It's broken out by at least the next longer timeframe, which would be the short timeframe. Just while we're here, the longer the balance has existed, the higher the odds that the move or the opportunity will be meaningful. Okay, now when you have balance, I should cover it. Like I say, there's nothing simple about what we do. When you have a three-day balance, you have three things that can happen.</p>
<p><h3>[33:30 - 34:00] `frame_0068.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>When you have a three-day balance, you have three things that can happen. You come in on the fourth day, the market can remain in balance, right? When a market remains in balance and it trades from the top to the bottom of the balance, no matter three days, five days, etc., that is a short-term trader's paradise. They love that kind of trading. So, one, it could stay within the balance. Secondly, it could look above the balance and fail, right? It attempts to go out of balance, it fails.</p>
<p><h3>[34:00 - 34:30] `frame_0069.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It attempts to go out of balance, it fails. If it attempts to go out of balance and fail, that usually sets up a pretty good opportunity in the opposite direction. Another term will introduce what I call a destination trade. It looks above the balance and fails. The destination trade, or at least the target, becomes the opposite end of the balance. Okay? So, one, it stays within balance. Two, it looks above the balance and fails. Three, it breaks out of the balance and goes. So, if you're coming in today and you've got a three-day balance, you're doing your homework tonight, you ought to be prepared for at least those three scenarios.</p>
<p><h3>[34:30 - 35:00] `frame_0070.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So, if you're coming in today and you've got a three-day balance, you're doing your homework tonight, you ought to be prepared for at least those three scenarios. So, you're going to have the reference, you're going to have daytime frame reference, and you're going to have the reference of the three-day high and low. So, if you come in, part of being prepared, you say, okay, what am I going to do if it stays within the balance? What am I going to do if it looks above it and fails? What am I going to do if it looks above it and goes? So, at least you have prepared for three likely scenarios on the following day.</p>
<p><h3>[35:00 - 35:30] `frame_0071.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So, at least you have prepared for three likely scenarios on the following day. You are going to be very much harder to compete against when you come in prepared with your references and prepared with scenarios that you might find of interest the following days. So, if you're coming in today and you've got a three-day balance, you're doing your homework tonight, you ought to be prepared for at least those three scenarios. So, you're going to have the reference, you're going to have daytime frame reference, and you're going to have the reference of the three-day high and low.</p>
<p><h3>[35:30 - 36:00] `frame_0072.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So, you're going to have the reference, you're going to have daytime frame reference, and you're going to have the reference of the three-day high and low. So, if you come in, part of being prepared, you say, okay, what am I going to do if it stays within the balance? What am I going to do if it looks above it and fails? What am I going to do if it looks above it and goes? So, at least you have prepared for three likely scenarios on the following day. You are going to be very much harder to compete against when you come in prepared with your references and prepared with scenarios that you might find of interest the following days.</p>
<p><h3>[36:00 - 36:30] `frame_0073.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You are going to be very much harder to compete against when you come in prepared with your references and prepared with scenarios that you might find of interest the following days. Okay, let's take a look at the next reference. Another reference are anomalies. Remember, a little while ago, we had a market up here, and off to the right, we had one set of TPOs, meaning time price opportunities, reading from left to right, that was stuck out like a rough edge farther than anything else on the profile. And I said yesterday when I was talking about this, I'm sure several people in the audience are saying, okay, get on.</p>
<p><h3>[36:30 - 37:00] `frame_0074.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And I said yesterday when I was talking about this, I'm sure several people in the audience are saying, okay, get on. It's one price, it's one line. What was the high? We looked in the market today. The high was right up at exactly at that anomaly. So, it's another reference, and it may not be tomorrow, but I keep them. And all it is, it's when the structure lacked symmetry. When you have a good structure, there will be some kind of symmetry. When you start to see it lacks symmetry, you start to say, wait a minute, the trading wasn't smooth, maybe it was a little forced. Very often, it will come back and smooth out that symmetry.</p>

<blockquote>EXCESS</blockquote></p>
<p>Very often, it will come back and smooth out that symmetry. Okay, let's take a look at some more references. Time frame. So, intermediate time frame reference. So, we look up here, if we're using a longer term chart, when you look up there, you say, okay, it doesn't take a genius to pull up a bar chart and say that's the highest the market's been in some period of time, right? You look up there, that's going to be an intermediate term reference. Then you may sit there and say, okay, over here, look within that, if I take this as the bottom of the trading range, the intermediate, and the top, I look in here, then I have a short term trading range in the center of it.</p>
<p><h3>[37:30 - 38:00] `frame_0076.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Then you may sit there and say, okay, over here, look within that, if I take this as the bottom of the trading range, the intermediate, and the top, I look in here, then I have a short term trading range in the center of it. Okay? So, I can have a short term reference, which is 3 to 5 days, within the intermediate time frame. Right in here, I can have another short term reference. Down here, at the low of that range, I have an intermediate term reference on the bottom. I have an intermediate term reference on the top.</p>
<p><h3>[38:00 - 38:30] `frame_0077.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I have an intermediate term reference on the top. Then I can kind of calculate the center of the range, and you say, well, why would you do that? It's just something I do to help me keep perspective. Where am I trade location on an intermediate term trade relative to the top and the bottom of that intermediate term trading range or bracket? Then I can see I have another short term. I got a 3-day balance in there. So, I continually go through and mark my charts with reference points.</p>
<p><h3>[38:30 - 39:00] `frame_0078.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So, I continually go through and mark my charts with reference points. I print them out, I keep them next to my computer. If I do this, a lot of times I'll do this on the weekend, so I don't have a lot to update during the week. Okay? Let's take a look at what else we've got in here. Longer term reference, okay? This is a monthly bar. Here's the intermediate term reference at $85 on crude. Okay? So, that is a monthly basis. It's going to be, what?</p>
<p><h3>[39:00 - 39:30] `frame_0079.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It's going to be, what? A nine month? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I guess that's a 19 month high up there. That's a long term reference. Okay? taken out that reference? We took out that reference, I think, didn't we trade up to the $87 range? You know, in there? Now, so if I look above a reference and go, I look above a reference and fail, it keeps me, it keeps my perspective in the marketplace. We</p>
<p><h3>[39:30 - 40:00] `frame_0080.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>above a reference and fail, it keeps me, it keeps my perspective in the marketplace. We could go on a long time talking about these references. What I'm trying to do in this video is introduce you to the concepts that you then go back and you study on your own and start to decide if they make sense and do you understand them and you make them relative to the time frame that you're interested in. A lot of times, a mistake that a lot of short-term traders make and the reason I talk so much about short-term trading, our audience, there's</p>
<p><h3>[40:00 - 40:30] `frame_0081.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>traders make and the reason I talk so much about short-term trading, our audience, there's more short-term traders than there are long-term traders. So our audience tends to be larger on the short time frame. The biggest mistake that short-term traders make is forgetting about where the longer time frame references are. When you get run over in a market, it is usually because you fail to recognize that the market reached a level that brought the, it came to the attention of the short, intermediate or very long time frame trader. And that's</p>
<p><h2>Section 6: it came to the attention of the short, intermediate or very</h2></p>

<p>it came to the attention of the short, intermediate or very long time frame trader. And that's when all of a sudden you say, what in the world happened to this market today? It got to a level where other time frames were interested, interested in buying, interested in selling, whatever it is, but they came off the sideline. They came off the sideline and became participants in the market, started to dominate the market. And you say, I have no idea what happened. Okay, let's take a look at more longer term references. This is the monthly bar for the crack spread.</p>
<p><h3>[41:00 - 41:30] `frame_0083.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>let's take a look at more longer term references. This is the monthly bar for the crack spread. Okay. And we're up along the long-term reference high. The reference high here at the high is $11.75. Okay. Today, a couple of traders in here trade the crack spread. There's the long-term reference. What we had a big breakout on the crack spread today. What's the high on the crack spread today? $15.38. $15.38. Okay. $11.75 when we did this chart a few days ago, but now we have this big</p>
<p><h3>[41:30 - 42:00] `frame_0084.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>today? $15.38. $15.38. Okay. $11.75 when we did this chart a few days ago, but now we have this big breakout to the upside $15.38. That's a huge move from a lot. I don't know where it actually broke from, but from $11.75 to today's high. What's that? What's a one lot worth money-wise there? One lot on that spread? $10 a tick. $10 a tick. $10 a tick. That's a huge move. You see what happens? The importance of understanding these references and when time change, time frame changes, it really can make or break you.</p>
<p><h3>[42:00 - 42:30] `frame_0085.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>understanding these references and when time change, time frame changes, it really can make or break you. Okay. Let's continue. The two most important concepts, I already talked about one. I talked about excess. Excess and balance. Excess happens in all time frames, whether it be five minutes, 30 minutes, daily, monthly, yearly. Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction. Excess is the moment of greatest risk.</p>
<p><h3>[42:30 - 43:00] `frame_0086.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of another auction. Excess is the moment of greatest risk. It is also the moment of greatest reward if you are positioned correctly. If a market makes an excess high and falls away from it very quickly, like if you went to a good auction and the auctioneer did it really did a wonderful job. He takes it up and he squeezes the last bit out of the auction.</p>
<p><h3>[43:00 - 43:30] `frame_0087.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>like if you went to a good auction and the auctioneer did it really did a wonderful job. He takes it up and he squeezes the last bit out of the auction. And we said the example we used earlier, say you got $150 for it or $150,000, whatever it is. And he said, oh, by the way, I've got one more. If he did a really good auction, that second one shouldn't go for any more than about $125,000, right? If he completed the auction, it should fall away from there quickly. That's what excess does. This is all about the auction process, right? So when you get an excess high, whether it be daily, weekly, monthly, hourly, you walk up, you've completed the auction, you fall away from it very quickly.</p>

<p>That's what excess does. This is all about the auction process, right? So when you get an excess high, whether it be daily, weekly, monthly, hourly, you walk up, you've completed the auction, you fall away from it very quickly. If in fact, if in fact you get short with that, you're in a great position. If you stay long, it's the greatest risk you're going to take because you've just had a change in auctions and your position in the wrong way. Now, when you look at that on paper, it sounds pretty simple. However, keep in mind, when the auction goes up, let's say the excess happens on the high, the excess is going to occur in the face of the most recent market activity.</p>
<p><h3>[44:00 - 44:30] `frame_0089.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Now, when you look at that on paper, it sounds pretty simple. However, keep in mind, when the auction goes up, let's say the excess happens on the high, the excess is going to occur in the face of the most recent market activity. So what your eyes just saw was a market making a new high. It falls away from it. And I'm telling you what your position should be short now. How hard is that trade to do? You know better. You just saw the market going up, right? So you have to work with this concept for a period of time to appreciate the power of it. But if you relate it to the auction process and say, wait a minute, once the auction is over, it ought to drop away from it very quickly.</p>
<p><h3>[44:30 - 45:00] `frame_0090.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So you have to work with this concept for a period of time to appreciate the power of it. But if you relate it to the auction process and say, wait a minute, once the auction is over, it ought to drop away from it very quickly. Okay, the second, the second concept that is so powerful. And again, these are two concepts you can walk out of here and use tomorrow. A lot of the things we talk about, there's more ambiguity, there's more context, you have to take them and you have to make them part of your daily trading and part of your life for a long period of time before they become internalized. But balance, when you come out of balance, the market is starting a new auction. So it is the start of a new auction. Again, it is the moment of greatest risk and the moment of greatest opportunity.</p>
<p><h3>[45:00 - 45:30] `frame_0091.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But balance, when you come out of balance, the market is starting a new auction. So it is the start of a new auction. Again, it is the moment of greatest risk and the moment of greatest opportunity. We talked about the crack spread breaking to the upside. Okay, it was almost four bucks above what the four bucks or 40 cents above what we were at just a few days ago. Okay. If you sit down and we looked at gold, gold was up $22.80 today, we saw it break above a new high, right? You came out of balance. You started a new auction. Moment of greatest risk, moment of greatest opportunity.</p>
<p><h3>[45:30 - 46:00] `frame_0092.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If you sit down and we looked at gold, gold was up $22.80 today, we saw it break above a new high, right? You came out of balance. You started a new auction. Moment of greatest risk, moment of greatest opportunity. A lot of greatest opportunity. A lot of greatest opportunity. A lot of greatest opportunity. A lot of times, it is easy to talk about. It is very hard to execute because it flies in the face of what you have been seeing. and we tend to, unless we have worked on our imagination, unless we've worked on these concepts, it is really hard to go against something you've just seen.</p>
<p><h3>[46:00 - 46:30] `frame_0093.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>it is really hard to go against something you've just seen. Or if it breaks to the upside and it's a new breakout, you're being asked to pay 12 for something you could have paid 10 for yesterday. So I'm not doing that. I'm no fool. And those are the really big trades. Those are the big opportunities. So that's excess imbalance. Two very, very important concepts. Okay. Balance. Approximately, and I ask you to do this on your own. I don't care if it's monthly, weekly, or anything else.</p>
<p><h3>[46:30 - 47:00] `frame_0094.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I don't care if it's monthly, weekly, or anything else. About 85% of the days will have some meaningful overlap with each other. How many people in here trade options? Okay. A few people trade options. Part of the problem with trading options is the loss of time premium. You know, and a lot of that happens because of the overlap, the days and overlap and the time premium starts to disappear. And if you walk through here, and I don't care if you're using daily, weekly, monthly, but you'll see there's a tremendous amount of overlap.</p>
<p><h3>[47:00 - 47:30] `frame_0095.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>THE DOLLAR HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY VOLATILE—</blockquote>
<blockquote>AN ENVIRON WHERE REGRESSION TO MEAN TRADING</blockquote>
<blockquote>IN THE DAY TIME FRAME IS FINANCIALLY CRIPPLING</blockquote></p>
<p>but you'll see there's a tremendous amount of overlap. As long as you know that and understand it, it will start to help you adjust and build your strategies as well as your tactics. Okay. Short-term balance. Again, I threw this term out before, and I love it. Short-term balance is absolute paradise for short-term traders. Because what are you doing? You're trying to trade the top to the bottom of the balance. So it's paradise there. However, what happens to traders?</p>
<p><h3>[47:30 - 48:00] `frame_0096.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>However, what happens to traders? How many times do you hear me say, traders do what works until what? Until it doesn't work anymore. So now, let's say a market's been in a four-day balance, and you've been pretty good at identifying the top and the bottom of that balance for the past four days. Now, on day five, you break out from the top of the five-day balance. Most traders are going to do what? They're going to fade the breakout.</p>
<p><h2>Section 7: They're going to fade the breakout</h2></p>
<p><h3>[48:00 - 48:30] `frame_0097.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>They're going to fade the breakout. Because all of a sudden, they're going to see it. They're going to see it. Oh, another chance to fade or sell at the top of the balance. So they sell it, and they're absolutely as wrong as wrong can be. Because the market has broken out to the upside. As long as you understand that's the process, you can operate very successfully within that framework. Now, here's something that I disagree with almost everybody that teaches about how to work and trade with markets.</p>
<p><h3>[48:30 - 49:00] `frame_0098.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Now, here's something that I disagree with almost everybody that teaches about how to work and trade with markets. People will tell you, and it always sounds so good, they put their arm around you and they're really being your friend. Let me tell you what you do. You figure out what it is you do best, and then you concentrate on what it is that you are the best at. I don't believe that. I think if you're going to be a professional trader, you have got to learn to be able to adjust to what the market is doing. You want to make a living out of this? If it's a hobby, that's fine. Go do what you think.</p>
<p><h3>[49:00 - 49:30] `frame_0099.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Go do what you think. If you're talking about being a professional trader, you have to be able to trade every kind of market. You've got a market that's in a trading range, you become a trading, you trade the trading range. Trading ranges are going to be mostly regression to the mean type of trades. Okay? Market breaks out of the trading range, then you've got to be a more aggressive trend type of trader and go with the breakout. You have to be able to trade what is going on in the market.</p>
<p><h3>[49:30 - 50:00] `frame_0100.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You have to be able to trade what is going on in the market. So many times we get this thing down. Well, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do short-term trades, and it works for a while, and all of a sudden it just takes you out of the game, and you don't understand. People say, well, I'm really there. I'm almost there, Jim. You know, if I hadn't been for that one day. Well, that one day was probably the day that you broke out of a range, and it takes back multiple days. Not only do you lose financial capital, but more importantly when that happens, you lose something even more valuable,</p>
<p><h3>[50:00 - 50:30] `frame_0101.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>you lose something even more valuable, and that's emotional capital. When you lose emotional capital, you lose confidence. When you lose confidence, it is very difficult to trade and trade smartly. You get behind emotionally. You start thinking worst-case scenarios. You start engaging in some behavior that is self-destruct. We're in a period right now, for those that are, you know, when you look at this video down the road, you probably won't recall it, but we're in a situation right now where there's talk about some economic problems in Greece.</p>
<p><h3>[50:30 - 51:00] `frame_0102.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>where there's talk about some economic problems in Greece. That has spread over to Portugal. That has spread over to Spain. And now they're talking about contagion, and now this may affect the entire world. With that, the dollar has become the vehicle of choice. Right up here, we're looking at the dollar index, which I think is comprised of six different curves, but it makes up, you know, that trading. That's what we use to kind of measure it on the market. But the volatility is extreme.</p>
<p><h3>[51:00 - 51:30] `frame_0103.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It is not regression to the mean type of trading. Trying to keep it on, you've got excess, you've got excess, you've got gaps. It's all over the lot. If that's too volatile for you, stop. But you cannot do dinky little regression to the mean trade in this type of environment. It's also what I call background. You have to, you ought to make a note of what is actually going on in the market. Is the market trading on its own, or is it being driven by other outside factors?</p>
<p><h3>[51:30 - 52:00] `frame_0104.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>or is it being driven by other outside factors? Many traders can't expand their imagination to move beyond the intuitive and misleading concept that there is more risk to paying 12 than there is paying 10 for something. Trading is, a lot of trading, is about creative problem solving. Very important to be a creative problem solver. Be a creative problem solver,</p>
<p><h3>[52:00 - 52:30] `frame_0105.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Be a creative problem solver, you need to develop an imagination. To enjoy imagination, you have to let your mind open up and kind of wonder. When you look today, if you start to study balance, and you start your mind to expand, you say, wait a minute, if I broke into a new high in gold, or in the crack spread, I could move gold, I could move $22. Well, if your imagination only lets you see three or four dollars, guess what? You don't have a chance. There's an awful lot of imagination involved.</p>
<p><h3>[52:30 - 53:00] `frame_0106.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>There's an awful lot of imagination involved. New discovery, new trends, new things. They're covered and they're found out by imagination. My biggest mistakes I ever make is I get so focused on a market because it's lulled me to sleep, it's been in a, you know, kind of a tight trading range for some period of time. You just can't imagine that this market could break out and just go like crazy. And it happens all the time. So it's a question of imagination.</p>
<p><h3>[53:00 - 53:30] `frame_0107.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So it's a question of imagination. You got a two-day balance. We come out of the two-day balance. You want to be able to go with those trades, monitor for continuation. Sometimes you'll be surprised how big the move can be. Okay, let's take a look at some more. This is the daily balance, mini S&P. I just wanted to kind of walk through some examples in here. What do I have down there? I have one, two, three, four, five, six,</p>
<p><h3>[53:30 - 54:00] `frame_0108.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I have one, two, three, four, five, six, if I counted right, a seven, eight, looks like a nine-day balance. Then it breaks out of that balance, right? So the market comes up to here. We broke out of this balance right here. We broke out of this balance. There's the breakout day. We came up and balanced again. Notice this balance and this balance. We balanced again, and the market is moving higher. Understanding coming out of balance is really the trend.</p>

<p>is really the trend. You've got a trend underway. So this is in the February and March period. What is this right here? Excess. Excess, right? That's excess. Excess marks what? The end of what? One auction. The beginning of? A new auction. Where was this market going before we put the excess in? It's going down, right? Right there, it goes down. It puts in the low.</p>
<p><h3>[54:30 - 55:00] `frame_0110.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We mark the end of one auction, the beginning of another auction. If I remember, this auction was only a mere 600 points or so. Okay? Once it got under, once it got underway. The two most important concepts you'll ever deal with are? Excess. Excess. Excess. And balance. End of one auction, start of a new auction. Balance, start of a new auction. Okay? Let's continue to walk through this. Monthly balance.</p>
<p><h3>[55:00 - 55:30] `frame_0111.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Monthly balance. We get the same thing in monthly balances. So, here we are right here. The market has been balancing on a monthly basis. There's an intermediate term excess high. Remember, this is a monthly. Intermediate term excess high. From that high, the market trades all the way back down, right? Trades all the way back down, almost to the other end of the extreme. And this would be called what? If we looked up here and failed</p>
<p><h3>[55:30 - 56:00] `frame_0112.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>If we looked up here and failed on this intermediate auction, and we auction all the way down here, what would that be called on the bottom of that trading range? Destination trade. It's a reference point. But remember, once we look above something, then I start thinking, and the term I use is destination trade. I then start thinking the destination trade, if I fail at this end of balance, the destination trade is down here to the opposite end of balance. If I looked at, if I took out yesterday's high</p>
<p><h3>[56:00 - 56:30] `frame_0113.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>if I took out yesterday's high and a daily thing, and the market fails, I would start thinking the possibility that I could trade down to yesterday's low. That would be my destination trade. Does it mean it has to trade there? No. But at least it gives me a reference to see how that auction is progressing. So now, we come up. Remember, this is long-term. We break above. We come in here. We break above. We take out this excess, and the market's off and running.</p>
<p><h2>Section 8: and the market's off and running</h2></p>
<p><h3>[56:30 - 57:00] `frame_0114.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>and the market's off and running. And then you develop more long-term excess, and you start to work your way back down. This is the monthly bar. So this is actually not good. It looks like it's not a very long time, but remember, it's on a monthly basis. Right down here, the market was right down here, and it was pressing. These are the bonds. It was pressing to go back. We were trading over here. People were talking about taking out the low going back to 2007.</p>

<p>going back to 2007. We're down on the bottom. You had the people coming on TV talking about bonds were really bad. The foreigners were going to stop buying our bonds. China, Japan. They had the whole world scared to death. That were going lower on the bonds. In the paper the other day, there was an article about, oh, one of the, they were blaming Nisan Taleb,</p>
<p><h3>[57:30 - 58:00] `frame_0116.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>the author, one of my favorite authors, who wrote The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness. Great, great writer that you ought to read multiple times. They were blaming him for the market. He put in a $7.5 million order to buy 50,000 option contracts. So that was one of the culprits. But Taleb writes about randomness in the market. Fooled by randomness, the black swan, and exogenous events causing these things.</p>
<p><h3>[58:00 - 58:30] `frame_0117.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And I always was amazed because down at the bottom, for a guy that believes in randomness, he was on TV talking about how bad the bonds, what was going to happen to the bonds. And guess what? That may be right for a long-term basis. But that's not where the bonds went. That's probably, what, about an $8,000 move? I forget exactly what the low was. If you take that reference point, when this market on a long-term basis,</p>
<p><h3>[58:30 - 59:00] `frame_0118.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>when this market on a long-term basis, as much as they pressed on this, as much as they pressed on this, they didn't get it. Okay? First of all, how did you get down here, down this low in the first place? People were doing what? Selling the market, right? And we talked, we used the term earlier, short in the hole. Short in the hole means short at very bad prices. Now, generally, we think of being short in the hole as happening to daytime frame traders.</p>
<p><h3>[59:00 - 59:30] `frame_0119.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>as happening to daytime frame traders. But you saw, we had, we have scalpers, we have daytime frame, short time, intermediate, long term. Guess what? It happens to all time frames. When we got down here, I think it's pretty clear that we had the whole, down in here, I'm sorry, we had the whole world short. And when you, when you get down here, and you can't go any further,</p>
<p><h3>[59:30 - 1:00:00] `frame_0120.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>sometimes the market has to rally before what? Before it breaks. One thing, it's easier to understand in the daytime frame, but if this is longer time frame, watch out. Incidentally, those that get some of my written comments, what did I write the other day? Picked up an article, and it's a, it's a publication, it goes out to some hedge funds, that the 10-year bond was at historic low rates. I'm sorry, the 10-year bond was historic short interest.</p>
<p><h3>[1:00:00 - 1:00:30] `frame_0121.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>was historic short interest. The shortest the 10-year bond had ever been recorded. Right smack on the bottom of the market. Guess what? That's not daytime frame traders, right? Your long time frame traders were short at very bad prices in the marketplace. Now, at the same time, you really want to understand markets, and somebody help me if I get the numbers wrong, but there was another article not too long ago, and Goldman Sachs was looking for</p>
<p><h3>[1:00:30 - 1:01:00] `frame_0122.jpg`</h3></p>

<p>and Goldman Sachs was looking for three and a quarter on the 10-year, three and a quarter yield on the 10-year, and Morgan Stanley was looking for what? Five? Five and a half. Three and a quarter, five and a half yield. Two big trading firms, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, three and a quarter, five and a half. That is absolutely a huge difference. Two of the biggest players in the world having totally different opinions</p>
<p><h3>[1:01:00 - 1:01:30] `frame_0123.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>having totally different opinions on where the bond market is going. And I say that, and the importance is that, is the reason that you want to get involved in what I'm talking about is you don't want to pick sides. You don't want to have to pick sides with Goldman or Morgan Stanley. You want to be able to read the market on your own, look at the market-generated information, understand the auction process, and trade the market accordingly.</p>
<p><h3>[1:01:30 - 1:02:00] `frame_0124.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>and trade the market accordingly. We got down here, and we didn't take out this low. We got the whole world short. And where's the market? It's off and running. It's hard for anybody to imagine the market could go that high. Now, people say, well, Jim, yeah, but that was only because of the flight to safety, because of what was going on in Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Contagion. I say, yes, that may have attributed to it, but guess what? If the market conditions weren't set up properly,</p>
<p><h3>[1:02:00 - 1:02:30] `frame_0125.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>weren't set up properly, it wouldn't have got there. In other words, if the market wasn't too short, you probably never would have gotten there. But once the market gets caught short, one short cover begets another short cover, and then you have price-based systems, and you got these traders that have price-based systems and hedge funds, and they start buying based on their price-based systems, hey, we're off and running. Does it make sense? Maybe not. Does it happen?</p>
<p><h3>[1:02:30 - 1:03:00] `frame_0126.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Absolutely. There will be huge disconnects continually between what the economic reality is and what the market reality is. The only reality, if you're going to be a trader, that means anything to you is the market reality. If you want to be an economist, get into another business. We bury economists in the trading world. You know, this is trading. Remember, I also said trading's a game.</p>
<p><h3>[1:03:00 - 1:03:30] `frame_0127.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I also said trading's a game. When the traders know that they've got the long time frame caught short, guess what the hedge funds are going to do? They're going to squeeze them, right? They're going to, you hear people talk about, and somebody was sitting up in the front row, they said, well, Jim, aren't there market makers that take the other side of the trade? You know, and half the people that have been around were trying to keep a straight face in the room because these market makers, theoretically, if the market's going bid,</p>
<p><h3>[1:03:30 - 1:04:00] `frame_0128.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>if the market's going bid, they're not taking the other side. They're doing what? They're joining the bid. They're going to squeeze it. They're going to squeeze it just as hard as they can possibly squeeze it. So you get these tremendous moves in the market. They have nothing to do with reality, nothing to do with the fundamentals, a lot, but it has to do with market-generated information. An auction is going to go until it's over, right? You go to an auction, it doesn't make any difference how much work you've done and how much you think something's worth</p>

<p>something's worth at the auction. If somebody's willing to pay more for it, guess what? That auction's going higher. Okay, let's go on. We have a weekly balance in bonds. So when I look at my charts, I look at the monthly balance, I look at the weekly balance, I mark the references for the highs and lows so I know where those levels are. Let's take a look at the next slide. Okay? Now we have a spike.</p>
<p><h3>[1:04:30 - 1:05:00] `frame_0130.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Now we have a spike. So we have an excess spike in here, another form of reference. When I get the spike, what did I call it? If the spike is to the downside, and we see that's pretty high, we got the spike, but it stayed pretty wide up there. So the market was already showing us some indication that it didn't want to go much lower. But we're looking at those things, we're counting that as a reference.</p>
<p><h3>[1:05:00 - 1:05:30] `frame_0131.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>we're counting that as a reference. 1040.75 was the low for the year. So even though we got the spike, we got the spike down there, we got to the low for the year, that reference worked, and the market started to move off of that reference. The break the last week, if you look on a bar chart, you will see that when the market went down 1,000 points,</p>
<p><h3>[1:05:30 - 1:06:00] `frame_0132.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>when the market went down 1,000 points, it went down to the excess low from February. And we talked about that earlier. We got the excess low, then it rallied, the first rally out of it was 600 points. Before it was all done, it was substantially larger than that. But the market went down to a very identifiable break last week when it was down 1,000. Now the question is, you know, were you fast enough? I didn't have an imagination that told me we could go down to that reference. I pride myself on imagination that wasn't one of them that worked very well.</p>
<p><h2>Section 9: that worked very well</h2></p>
<p><h3>[1:06:00 - 1:06:30] `frame_0133.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>that worked very well. Okay, let's continue to move on. Long-term balance and excess. In here, we've looked at this before, or something similar. Our excess low, the market's been going this way, excess marks the end of one auction, the beginning of the next auction. Then, the market starts to rally higher. One of the things that we do to judge the age of a trend,</p>
<p><h3>[1:06:30 - 1:07:00] `frame_0134.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>to judge the age of a trend, most people get trapped by judging the age of a trend by their intuitive feeling that price is too high or too low or whatever. Okay? There's the excess. Excess starts a new auction, right? Excess goes up, and what do I have right here? I have a balance. So, a balance for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight days. Then, what do I have here? It does. It breaks out of this,</p>
<p><h3>[1:07:00 - 1:07:30] `frame_0135.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>It breaks out of this, and I balance again. Okay? The balance, there's a balance. If I, well, right down there, we'll call this the first balance. No, we can, this is actually a balance right in here. Once it re-entered this, the destination trade becomes up here someplace, then I got a balance, a balance again. When we have balances, doesn't work perfectly, but the distance between one balance to another balance is an indication</p>
<p><h3>[1:07:30 - 1:08:00] `frame_0136.jpg`</h3></p>

<blockquote>“~ BALANCE</blockquote>
<blockquote>EXCESS</blockquote></p>
<p>is an indication of the age of the trend. If you take the high of one balance and the low of the next balance, and you can put your pencil or a finger between it, the option is relatively low. when the next balance area sits on top of or back within the previous balance area, doesn't mean the auction's over. It means it's aging. We break out of here. We do get a little three-day balance, but coming out of here,</p>
<p><h3>[1:08:00 - 1:08:30] `frame_0137.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>but coming out of here, the next balance is considerably higher. So what that's, this from here, from the excess up to here, to here, it's telling me that the auction is still relatively what? Still relatively young. Now, that may contrast, contrast tremendously with what your intuitive feelings are telling you. It may contrast with what you hear on the news, but if you sit there and do your own work, even looking right here,</p>
<p><h3>[1:08:30 - 1:09:00] `frame_0138.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>even looking right here, coming down, the balance between here and here, the market's got a lot longer to, it's a pretty good move. That's 11.40, finally moves down here to about, what is that, 10.40, about another 100 handles. Balance, break below it, balance, you can drive two dreams of a car and a truck through here, right? Balance, it's still fairly young. We've distanced, this isn't quite as much, but notice, we never really balance.</p>
<p><h3>[1:09:00 - 1:09:30] `frame_0139.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>we never really balance. We've got the excess and now we're back up into here. So, if you took the next balance right here, you see how it's kind of back into that balance? You get the feeling that you've got excess on the bottom. You didn't, your next balance, if I took it right through here, your next balance is back really into this. So, you're getting aged, you're getting older. Now, you're really starting to accelerate up there. It's a younger auction. Again, much more reliable than thinking what you feel intuitive</p>
<p><h3>[1:09:30 - 1:10:00] `frame_0140.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>what you feel intuitive or what you read or anything else. Non-linear breaks. You'll hear me talk a lot about coming out of balance. You get a non-linear break. These are the, these are good profit potentials. They are also killers if you are the wrong way in a market. A non-linear break is nothing more than a very rapid reordering of the thinking in a marketplace. People resist change forever.</p>
<p><h3>[1:10:00 - 1:10:30] `frame_0141.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>People resist change forever. How many name, know the name, Kuhn? K-U-K-U-H. Kuhn was a scientist born in, I think, 1922. And one of the words that he made famous was paradigm shift. Paradigm shift just, it just simply means a reorder of thinking. But when Kuhn goes through his whole explanation, people fight change drastically. They don't like change.</p>
<p><h3>[1:10:30 - 1:11:00] `frame_0142.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>GAPS ARE ALSO A FORM OF EXCESS</blockquote></p>
<p>They don't like change. So they put it off until there's so many anomalies that they can no longer deny that change is occurring. When they get to that realization, that is when you get a non-linear break in the market or you get a whole reorder of thinking. Now, when Kuhn was talking about, you know, paradigm shifts and all this, he was talking something much bigger than we're talking. But I find the same type of thing</p>
<p><h3>[1:11:00 - 1:11:30] `frame_0143.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>the same type of thing occurs in all time frames. Whether it's day time frame, they're dying like this, and everybody's got their narrow little view, and all of a sudden enough anomalies take place, and they realize they're wrong, and you get this huge rapid move out of one distribution to another. The same thing happens with the longer the time frame you go, it happens with all the way along. And I think this is not what Kuhn intended, but I think it's very similar. And these non-linear breaks</p>
<p><h3>[1:11:30 - 1:12:00] `frame_0144.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And these non-linear breaks are, so we get a non-linear break, we get a paradigm shift, now we go to a new model, a new way of thinking, a new status quo, and now we go back and we go into range-bound trading for a period of time. Paradise for shorter-term trading. I think this process happens continually. Even here, on this multi-day balance right here, what did we get right here? We got to, we look, now there's a case, we look below the balance, did we fail</p>
<p><h3>[1:12:00 - 1:12:30] `frame_0145.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>did we fail or were we successful? We failed, look below the balance, it failed, the bidders were there, the market was bad, and then, once you re-enter this, the destination trade becomes what? The other end, the destination trade comes up here. Anyhow, there's all kind of information in here. It's a lot harder when you're in front of a machine and price-in-moving than it is when you're sitting with, somebody's got pre-prepared slides. Okay, let's go on and see what we've got up. Gaps. Gaps are also</p>
<p><h3>[1:12:30 - 1:13:00] `frame_0146.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Gaps are also a form of excess. Gaps are also a form of non-linear movement. Gaps also perform very similar to Kuhn's philosophy of a paradigm shift, a reorder of thinking. When a market gap's higher or lower, at least from last night to this morning, there's a total reorder of thinking about what is the correct price or value. Gaps are extremely important. Now,</p>
<p><h3>[1:13:00 - 1:13:30] `frame_0147.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Now, for those that have done a lot of work in traditional market and thinking, you will think of a gap as the difference between last night's close or settle and today's opening. That is not the gap I'm talking about. I pay no attention to that. The gap I'm talking about is outside of yesterday's, totally outside of yesterday's range. It has nothing to do with last night's settle. It's outside of yesterday's range. So a gap has to go,</p>
<p><h3>[1:13:30 - 1:14:00] `frame_0148.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So a gap has to go, if it's a gap to the downside, it has to go below and stay below yesterday's range. That is a gap to the downside the way I look at it. Am I out of balance? I'm out of balance. I'm out of balance to a pretty good degree. Okay? Let's take a look at what we've got coming up next. Excess occurs in all time frames. You've heard this before. Marks the end of one auction, beginning of another auction. Is it applicable to the day time frame?</p>
<p><h3>[1:14:00 - 1:14:30] `frame_0149.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>EXCESS OCCURS IN ALL</blockquote>
<blockquote>TIMEFRAMES</blockquote>
<blockquote>EXCESS MARKS END OF</blockquote>
<blockquote>ONE AUCTION AND THE</blockquote>
<blockquote>BEGINNING OF ANOTHER</blockquote></p>
<p>to the day time frame? It is. I use 30 minute, I use 30 minute increments to construct my profiles. I don't care if you use 15 minutes, one hour. The principles are the same in all time frames. The principles ought to be exactly the same in all markets that are financial in nature. Now, I used to do this for real estate. I sold a home, I lived north of Chicago, I sold a home, I did the same thing. Now,</p>
<p><h3>[1:14:30 - 1:15:00] `frame_0150.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>they may have to advertise a little longer in real estate, but the principles ought to be the same, whether it's a bank allocating credit, real estate, financial markets, the only change will be things in the stock and futures market happen far more rapidly. But the basic three principles are time, price, and volume. Price does what? Advertises what? Opportunity. What regulates all advertised opportunity? It's time, right? And volume</p>
<p><h3>[1:15:00 - 1:15:30] `frame_0151.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>And volume measures the success or failure of all advertised opportunities. Three basic economic principles applicable to all markets that are financial in nature. Okay? What do we do? That's part of the auction process. We use the market profile to record the auction process and the dynamics of what is going on. What is different in our market is we continue to auction from high to low and low to high</p>
<p><h3>[1:15:30 - 1:16:00] `frame_0152.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>and low to high because it's a continuous two-way auction process. Excess starts the trade location process all over. We haven't talked about it yesterday, today. But let's go back and think about a 10-day, we looked at some charts that had like a 10-day balance. Let me talk about trade location for a second. If I am at the bottom or top extreme</p>
<p><h2>Section 10: or top extreme</h2></p>
<p><h3>[1:16:00 - 1:16:30] `frame_0153.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>or top extreme of a 10-day balance, does it take me very long to know if I'm right or wrong? If I buy at the bottom and I get outside, I know pretty quickly I'm wrong, I sell at the top, I know pretty quickly if I'm right or wrong. If I get emotionally involved and I buy right in the middle of a 10-day balance, how far does that market have to auction before I get confirmation that I'm right or wrong? It's got to go to one extreme</p>
<p><h3>[1:16:30 - 1:17:00] `frame_0154.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>to one extreme or the other, right? So now, let's talk about risk. Risk is a word that everybody throws around, but I don't think many people understand risk. Risk is a point, to me, risk is a point that where I know I'm wrong in a trade. So, if I look at a 10-day balance, one of the things I do and I say, okay, the bottom of that range is my lowest trade location, I go up a quarter, I go up a half,</p>
<p><h3>[1:17:00 - 1:17:30] `frame_0155.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I go up a half, three quarters at the top, I can calibrate, I can calibrate from a trade location standpoint, where I am entering into or exiting my trade. Trade location is one of the best risk qualifiers you'll ever run across. Remember, if I buy or sell in the middle of a 10-day balance, I've got to move an awful long way before I really know if I'm right or wrong. If I concentrate on trade location,</p>
<p><h3>[1:17:30 - 1:18:00] `frame_0156.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>EXCESS STARTS THE TRADE LOCATION</blockquote>
<blockquote>PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN</blockquote>
<blockquote>aoe T2548</blockquote>

<blockquote>teeceseeeeeege</blockquote>
<blockquote>PPPOE PPP PPP RDP PD DD</blockquote></p>
<p>on trade location, I can reduce my risk, I can know much quicker if I'm right or wrong, and also, if I'm right, I've got a much bigger opportunity. Trade location is one of the best risk qualifiers you will ever run across. And when you get excess, excess marks the end of what? One auction and the beginning of a new auction, right? So, excess also starts the trade location process all over again. So,</p>
<p><h3>[1:18:00 - 1:18:30] `frame_0157.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>So, if I buy right on the excess or a couple ticks above it, it doesn't take me long to know I'm wrong. the higher I get away from it, the greater the risk that I have, or theoretically. So, I'm only using that in one aspect. I'm using it to identify trade location. I'm using trade location as one element to identify what is my risk, how much risk am I employing. Okay. Again, we say here, it's very difficult</p>
<p><h3>[1:18:30 - 1:19:00] `frame_0158.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>it's very difficult to execute unless you have prepared. if you've got a market coming down and it's coming down on lower volume, poor structure, and I'm finally getting excess. If I see the market coming down, lower volume, poor structure, while I do my homework and preparation at night, I may start to prepare and looking for a buying opportunity. I'm saying, okay, I don't think it's completed yet. I don't think the auction process is completed. But I'm prepared</p>
<p><h3>[1:19:00 - 1:19:30] `frame_0159.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But I'm prepared and I'm looking for an opportunity. Now, I get an excess low. I'm already prepared. I've already mentally conditioned myself. Now, my ability to execute on that trade is far greater. Then all of a sudden, I'm the guy that came off the floor. I hung my coat up. I went and had a beer. I came in the next morning, put my trade on. The market starts to trade. I said, oh, what am I going to do the day? There is no preparation. When you get to that great opportunity, you probably won't recognize it. You won't be prepared</p>
<p><h3>[1:19:30 - 1:20:00] `frame_0160.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You won't be prepared to take advantage of it. So, as you do your preparation, your scenarios, you may say the last couple of days have been really poor coming down volume, structure, everything else. You say, it doesn't look completed. But if I get any kind of excess low or good trade location, I may look for a place to go long. I've done some preparation. I have some idea what I want to do. I have some kind strategic thinking. I have some idea of how tactically I may want</p>
<p><h3>[1:20:00 - 1:20:30] `frame_0161.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I may want to get into that trade. I am prepared. I will compete against you when I'm prepared. When I'm not prepared, it's going to be much harder because when price is moving around, it's really hard to think on the fly. It's really hard. And the more emotion, the more emotion you're under, the more unprepared you are, the more you start thinking worst case scenario, the more you start thinking worst case scenario, the narrower your thought process gets, the greater the opportunity that you're going to do exactly what you shouldn't do.</p>
<p><h3>[1:20:30 - 1:21:00] `frame_0162.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>what you shouldn't do. Okay? Let's continue and look here. Now, trade location is the best tool available for risk control. Same thing we've just talked about. Review. Excess starts the trade location process all over again. you can just kind of see from here back up to the top. Look it up here. Right there. There's a little balance. What's this trade location up here? Almost at the top, right?</p>
<p><h3>[1:21:00 - 1:21:30] `frame_0163.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE UNLESS YOU HAVE</blockquote>
<blockquote>PREPARED FOR IT AS IT REQUIRES THAT YOU</blockquote>
<blockquote>EXECUTE CONTRARY TO MARKET'S MOST RECENT</blockquote>
<blockquote>ACTIVITY</blockquote>
<blockquote>FRRRRESESRRP RRS</blockquote></p>
<p>Then we've got trade location and right here is a little excess. And what do we have right here? A little bit of balance, right? Bang! We come out of balance. What do you think your imagination can handle this? Unless you're prepared. But if I sit there and say the trade location is here. The trade location here. Balance is here. And you don't know it's going to be this big. But what you do want to do is be prepared. Coming out of balance, you want to be prepared to go with that trade.</p>
<p><h3>[1:21:30 - 1:22:00] `frame_0164.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>to go with that trade. It is going to be much harder to do because the breakout is going to be down in here someplace. So the market's already going to be down for the day. And if you don't understand it's a breakout from balance, it's going to be really hard for you to go with that trade. If you understand trade location from the top, you understand the balance, you come out of balance, you understand the destination trade is sometime, someplace down in the lower end. If you understand that, all of a sudden, your world starts to move in slow motion.</p>
<p><h3>[1:22:00 - 1:22:30] `frame_0165.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You start to see the trade developing. You know, it's like a pass. I'm in Chicago, just like Michael Jordan passing behind his back, looking off to the right. And you say, how did number 23 ever do that? Okay? Prepared. It's worked for a long period of time. The name of this video we're doing is called Field of Vision. Field of Vision, you get up there, you're looking at a lot of things. Your field of vision, it's taking in the high, it's taking in the low, it's taking in the balance, it's taking in the excess.</p>
<p><h3>[1:22:30 - 1:23:00] `frame_0166.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>it's taking in the excess. Let me share with you for a second how we came up with that name. I'm talking with Julia one day and Julia was a star field hockey player at UMass. And we were just talking about trading and the emotions and all the pieces that are involved and I said, tell me about the really good players at UMass. And she said, well, the best player</p>
<p><h3>[1:23:00 - 1:23:30] `frame_0167.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>the best player we had was Megan. Megan went to the Olympics twice? Three times. Megan went to the Olympics three times. She works for State Street Bank and Trust today and Julia said, it was hard to believe how calm she was. How calm she was and saw everything that was going on in the field. And she said, she never made an angle shot at the goal. Well, I mean, I wouldn't have known that but I said, well, an angle shot, an angle shot, guess what?</p>
<p><h3>[1:23:30 - 1:24:00] `frame_0168.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>I said, I can see you got more time to see it, you got more time to cut it off. She said her shot, when she made her shot, it was always straight, hard, and right at the goal. Kind of a direct shot. And then, out of her mouth came, she had a great field of vision. And I just said, thank you very much. I think we have the name of our trading video. Because it just made sense that that is what we're talking about. And then I quiz Julia Moore</p>
<p><h3>[1:24:00 - 1:24:30] `frame_0169.jpg`</h3></p>
<p><blockquote><strong>📊 Slide:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>ONCE THERE IS EXCESS WE SHOULD BEGIN</blockquote>
<blockquote>TO THINK DESTINATIONS</blockquote></p>
<p>Julia Moore about some of the other players. Yeah, she said there were other players that were more emotional, their shots were more erratic, more anxious to take the shots, not as much field of vision, not as much patience. But she said, you looked at Megan, you really never knew that she had the whole field of vision in mind. And it's just one of those things when that came out of her mouth, I just knew that was what it is. And as we thought about it for the next two or three days, we said that's got to be what it is. But that's what it's about.</p>
<p><h2>Section 11: But that's what it's about</h2></p>
<p><h3>[1:24:30 - 1:25:00] `frame_0170.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>But that's what it's about. And isn't this, you're taking in to do these really good trades and that's a great opportunity. You have to have the field of vision in mind. You can't make, you start making a few erratic shots or one of the other thing that goes on, you get this great opportunity is coming up and you're making some little insignificant trade. You get into some little insignificant trade. It's the wrong direction. And what's the problem with a bad trade? Problem with a bad trade,</p>
<p><h3>[1:25:00 - 1:25:30] `frame_0171.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>Problem with a bad trade, it keeps you out of a good trade. And we've all been there. We sit in front of our machines. We think we're paying for the quote equipment and everything else. We end up doing some trade that was meaningless and we miss the really big opportunities. We close down. We miss the field, the field of vision in there. Now what happens? We go all the way down to the lower. We looked at part of this before. We go all the way down to this extreme. Then what happens? We fail. We don't carry through.</p>
<p><h3>[1:25:30 - 1:26:00] `frame_0172.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>We don't carry through. Okay. Where's the next, where's the next auction going? We saw it on a daytime frame basis. It happens in all time frames. So then what did the market do? It started going back the other way. Okay. So it's all within the field. Destination trade, I threw it out. This is the first time I've seen, I think you've seen it in print. If you looked at, if you failed at yesterday's high, the thought you would be thinking about would be trading back down to yesterday's low as a potential destination trade. You look at the top</p>
<p><h3>[1:26:00 - 1:26:30] `frame_0173.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>You look at the top of a, of a balance area high and you fail. You start thinking that failed right there. You start thinking the destination trade down to the other end. Down on this side, look at the gap. Okay. The gap, you got a little balance down here. A gap is what? It's a reorder of thinking. It's a, going back to Kuhn, it's a paradigm shift. We just happened to use it in a much smaller time frame than he would have used it. A gap is also what?</p>
<p><h3>[1:26:30 - 1:27:00] `frame_0174.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>A gap is also what? It's also excess. I got a little excess there. The gap is excess, which actually confirms this. The market's off and running. I could go up there, back down to the destination trade. Does it always happen nicely? No, it doesn't. But at least it gives you some idea of the possibilities, something to think about and something to judge what is, what is occurring in the marketplace. That's the</p>
<p><h3>[1:27:00 - 1:27:30] `frame_0175.jpg`</h3></p>
<p>That's the Thank you.
