W hen Mind Over Markets was ﬁrst published in 1990, the Market

Proﬁle was relatively new. I was fascinated by the utility because it
provided a new way to structure information, a new way to look at the
market through a time-sensitive, evolving database that records the market’s
continuous two-way auction process.

I had long been skeptical about analysis that treated all prices as equal.
After years studying market behavior—with membership on the Chicago
Board of Trade and as a founding member of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange—I came to the conclusion that fundamental analysis is generally
too long term, often appearing out of touch with the market. Auction
market theory, on the other hand, seemed to offer the most objective means
of allocating the constant ﬂow of bids and offers.

I embraced the idea that auctions are mechanisms for price discovery.
Mind Over Markets is a practical handbook for developing an understanding
of market behavior that will help you trade with the odds in your favor. And
in the 20 years since it was ﬁrst published (and translated into Chinese and
French), my co-authors and I have continued to delve deeper into the
application of auction theory to trading and investment decisions.

In the ﬁrst printing, we talked about “buying and selling tails” in Proﬁle
structure. We’ll get into the mechanics of this concept later in the book, but
we mention them here, in this new introduction, because they represent an
example of how our understanding has evolved since the original publica-
tion, thanks to the best teacher of all: experience. We still believe in the

3GFPREF 

05/16/2013 

12:36:28 

Page  14

structural  signi ﬁcance  of  tails,  but  we  have  developed  a  more  nuanced
appreciation  for  what  causes  tails,  or  more  tellingly,  what  causes  the  lack  of  a
tail  (an  indication  that  the  market  has  gotten  too  long  or  too  short).

This  understanding —like  all  understanding —evolved  over  time.  It  is  the
context  surrounding  the  indicator  that  signals  a  deeper  layer  of  meaning.
Factors  like  volum e  and  tempo  provide  clues  about  which  timeframe  is
leading  market  movement.  And  as  you ’ ll  discover,  discern ing  timeframe

insights  you  can  develop  as  an
important 
agile-brained  trader.

is  one  of  the  mos t 

& Does  the  Pro ﬁle  Still  Work,  after
All  These  Years?

I’m  often  asked  if  the  Pro ﬁle  works.  Or,  more  commonly ,  if  it  still  works.
The  better  questi on  is  this:  Is  the  Market  Pro ﬁle  a  valid  scientiﬁ c  way  to
organize  data?

The  answer  to  that  question  is  a  de ﬁnite  yes.  The  Pro ﬁle  is  constructed
using  a  constant —time —on  the  horizontal  axis,  and  a  variable —price—on
the  vertical  axis  to  form  a  dist ribution.  Scientists  have  employed  this  method
to  study  and  observe  data  for  generations.  Personally,  I  would  much  rather
study  organized  data  than  unorganized  data;  the  Pro ﬁ le  is  simply  a  valuable
tool  for  organizing  objective  information.

After  a  lifetime  spent  observing  markets,  I  choose  to  give  more  emphasis
to  the  Market  Proﬁ le—with  its  evolving,  multidi mensional  structure —
because  I  believe  it  provides  a  more  accurate  representation  of  the  auction
process,  as  it  unfolds .  It  smooths  out  aberrations,  such  as  high  volum e  at  the
opening  bell,  as  well  as  stati stical  references  like  the  overnight  high  and  low
that  can  mislead  you  in  the  heat  of  the  moment.

interpr eting  data 

To  be  clear,  I ’ m  a  trader,  not  a  Pro ﬁle  trader.  However,  the  Proﬁ le  has
been  invaluable  to  my  analysis,  and  it  has  enabled  my  personal  evolution
its  ever-changing
through  decades  of  reading  and 
visualizations. Over time, my knowledge has deepened through prac-
tice—and not just practice, but correct practice. Choose any sport and
you’ll recognize the importance of practicing a correct stroke/shot/swing;
practice wrong and you’ll cement bad habits that can take years to unlearn.
One  of  the  most  astute  Amazon.com  revi ews  for  this  bo ok  was  not
intended as a compliment—the reviewer said Mind over Markets is “too
complicated.” Those two words capture the reason why most traders fail, as

well as the reason why the book in your hands is still relevant, challenging,
and insightful after two decades: It was written for serious traders, and it
doesn’t purport to be a total solution.

Ultimately, you must make your own decisions as you carefully choose
which tools you use, and which indicators you follow as you trade. Rest
assured that no matter what you decide, there is never a single, simple
answer. I suggest you compare volume proﬁles and Market Proﬁles side by
side, writing down your observations as you see how they mirror and/or
contradict each other. Constantly ask yourself, What does the ambiguity tell
you? Can you identify change before your competitors (mostly laggards) transform
opportunity into the familiar patterns of consensus?

& On the Long Road to Expert

In reading this book, you will begin to make progress on your path to
becoming a successful trader. Over time, you will transform insights into
instincts in the kiln of experience. And those instincts will help you rise
above the distracting maelstrom of conﬂicting information with a broader,
more holistic market perspective. You will begin to understand the big
picture, while also participating in the daily minutia—the hallmark of a
professional trader.

Developing this level of market understanding is not an easy process.
Most people ﬁnd it impossible to even begin to parse such an overwhelming
amount of ambiguous, conﬂicting information, let alone transcend it. But
armed with awareness, you have the ability to separate yourself from your
competitors, most of whom are lost in the shallows of price and opinion.
You have the opportunity to forge your own path toward expert.

Good luck on your journey!

O ur thanks to the individuals and organizations named below extends

far beyond the scope of the writing of this book. Mind Over Markets is
born out of years of teaching, research, and trading. In one way or another,
the following individuals and companies have made a signiﬁcant contribution
to this effort:

Second edition acknowledgment is to Julia Stuart, my partner at J. Dalton
Trading, who has worked with me over the past several years as a student, a
fellow trader, writer, and editor.

J. Peter Steidlmayer, who pioneered the theories upon which much of our
work is based. When I met Pete in 1985, one of the ﬁrst questions I asked
was “If your theories are so good, why share them with anyone else?” Pete’s
response was not what one would expect from a successful commodity
trader. He said, “The market has been good to me. Like Marshall Field’s
contribution to the city of Chicago was the Field Museum, my contribution
to the ﬁnancial world is a better way to trade.”

Peter Steidlmayer has always encouraged his students to take the
information he has provided and make it their own. In less than ﬁve years,
we have witnessed the birth of new types of quotation software, databases,
and all forms of expanded market research. Such is the natural process that
follows any signiﬁcant new discovery. Given the magnitude of the contri-
bution that Peter Steidlmayer has made to the ﬁnancial markets, this
information expansion will likely continue for a long time.

Norman Hovda, who, as a broker in the Soybean Meal pit at the Chicago
Board of Trade, observed Pete Steidlmayer as he came into the pit to trade.
It was Norman who ﬁrst introduced me to Pete, and that meeting has since
changed the way we look at markets. One of the equations to which you will
be introduced in this book is: Market Understanding þ (Self-Understanding (cid:2)
Strategy) ¼ Results. Norman’s specialty is Self-Understanding. Although he
remains a member of both the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, his primary focus is consulting businesses, schools,
and families on tools for Self-Help. Norman resides in Wilmette, Illinois.
Donald Jones, president of CISCO, a Chicago-based research and database
ﬁrm, has helped us in countless ways over the years. CISCO was the ﬁrst
database to begin providing the Market Proﬁle and Liquidity Data Bank to
the public. In addition to providing the data for many of the illustrations
presented in these pages, Don has also taken the time on numerous occasions
to share his ideas and analytical research.

Elaine Dalton, for her unwavering support both as a partner in business

and partner at home.

Barton J. Hanson, whose literary efforts and market research as Senior
Editor of the Proﬁle Report are indirectly woven into portions of this book.
Cletus Dobbs, for his vivid explanation of how the auction process works in

the real world—at a livestock sale. Cletus is a rancher in Texas.

Commodity Quote Graphics (CQG), for their quality, ongoing technical
support over the years. CQG is also responsible for the majority of the
charts and data presented in this book.

Introduction

1

Jim Kelvin was a retired cattle rancher from Texas. He had developed an

interest in the futures market during the years when he would hedge his
livestock at opportune prices. After he sold his ranching business, he began
to experiment with a few small trades as a hobby.

Jim read everything he could ﬁnd on futures trading. He studied all the
technical models, read manual after manual on market analysis, attended
seminars, and kept point and ﬁgure charts. In time, he felt he had a ﬁrm
grasp on all the factors that make the market tick and began to look at
trading as a serious vocation. He wasn’t making money, but he thought
he was just paying his dues as he learned the intricacies of his trading
system.

One morning, Jim got up at 6:00, as he always did, and went to his study
to turn on his quote monitors and prepare for the market’s open. He picked
up the Wall Street Journal to see what the bank traders and brokerage analysts
were saying about the foreign exchange market. He had been watching the
Japanese yen closely, because he felt the recent depth of coverage in the
news would surely reveal some good trade opportunities. The U.S. dollar
was expected to record new lows because of a slowing U.S. economy and
consistently negative trade balances, forcing the yen and other currencies
higher. All the foreign exchange related articles on his quote equipment
news service were bullish for the yen.

A good friend and fellow trader called and commented on how the
currencies should rally that day. Jim then checked the 24-day channel model
and the 16- to 32-day moving average crossover model, two longer term
technical indicators on which he frequently based his trading—both had
been generating buy signals for some time.

Jim glanced over his charts and volume numbers and chewed on the end
of a pencil. At the end of every day, he conducted a personal analysis of the
market’s structure and wrote down possible trades for the following day.
Last night he had written “weakening yen—look for opportunity to sell.”
The yen had been in an upward trend for some time, but in recent weeks
volume was drying up. Price was moving higher, but activity was decreasing
and there had been no substantial moves to the up side in over a week.
He knew from his ranching days that less volume was signiﬁcant. When
he would auction off his livestock, the price would continue up until the last
buyer had bought. When the auction was nearing its end, the bulk of the
buyers would have dropped out because they had fulﬁlled their inventory
requirement or the price was too high. When no one was left to buy, the
auction was over.

He read his analysis again. Common market sense told him that the up
auction in the yen was over. There were no more buyers. But what about all
the fundamental and technical indicators?

“All these professionals can’t be wrong,” Jim said to himself. “I can’t sell

the yen.”

The market was going to open in less than ﬁve minutes. Jim stared at his
blank monitor for a moment, thinking about what his friend had said. He put
his hand on the phone, but did not pick it up.

The yen opened higher, rose a few ticks, and then stalled. The ﬂoor
traders were acting on the recent bullish sentiment, but the buyers that had
driven the yen up for the past month were nowhere to be found. He just sat
and watched his terminal. It’s going to break . . .
I should sell, he thought.
The ﬂashing green price on his quote screen began to drop as he sank deeper
into his chair and indecision tightened its grip.

What happened? Jim Kelvin’s decision-making process was jammed by
the conﬂict between his own intuition and popular opinion. “How can the
majority be wrong?”

The majority of people who trade futures don’t make money. In fact,
over 90 percent aren’t successful enough to justify being in the market. If
you trade with the majority, then you will fare only as well as the average,
and the average market participant does not make money!

He was caught, like the goat that starves to death between two piles of
hay, in the conﬂict of multiple sources of information indicating opposite
conditions. Jim’s common sense and ﬁrm understanding of the market’s
auction process told him the yen was weak and should have been sold, but he
let himself become frozen by the power of the majority. All the fundamental

3GC01

Page 3

and technical indicators agreed—everyone was predicting the bull trend
to continue.

The difference is relatively simple. Jim was basing his opinion on current
market information—he was “listening” to the evolving market—while all
the other sources were based on information that was history and no longer
relevant to what the market was doing in the present tense.

What if a baseball catcher waited to see how fast a man stealing second
could run or pondered how often he was successful before he threw the ball?
There is no way the throw would be in time. A good catcher operates solely
in the present tense. He feels when the steal is on and reacts immediately,
just as an experienced trader feels the direction of the market and reacts
immediately.

Similarly, if a linebacker waited until he could see what the offense was
doing or tried to read the play by watching the scoreboard, he would never
make the key tackle. He reads the offense by recognizing patterns learned
from experience and by trusting his intuition—sensing the play. To wait is to
miss the opportunity. If you wait until a market has committed itself in a
direction, you are too late.

In Mind Over Markets, our goal is to teach you how to read the plays. In
more concrete terms, you will
learn how to identify the information
generated by the market, understand its implications, and act on your
knowledge. However, this is not a book about a trading system that works
or does not work. The Market Proﬁle is not a black box that dogmatically
tells you when to buy and sell commodities. This is a book on learning. This
is a book on observing and understanding the market.

Mind Over Markets is organized around the ﬁve basic steps in the learning
process, roughly corresponding to the ﬁve stages of skill acquisition
discussed in the book Mind Over Machine, by Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus.
To illustrate these stages, imagine a young man named David. He attends
a concert at his college given by a well-known contemporary pianist. While
listening to Beethoven’s haunting “Moonlight Sonata,” he is moved by
the pure emotion expressed in the piece and decides he must learn to play
the piano. The next day he arranges for his ﬁrst lesson.

In the ﬁrst few weeks, David learns to “recognize objective facts and
features relevant to the skill and acquires rules for determining actions based
on those facts and features.”1 In other words, he reaches the ﬁrst stage of

1 Hubert Dreyfus and Stuart Dreyfus, Mind Over Machine (New York: The Free Press,
1986), pp. 21–36.

learning: the novice. He learns that the black ellipse with a stem is a note, and
that a note placed on the bottom line of the treble staff is an E. He is shown
where the E is on the keyboard and can then press the corresponding key to
sound the note.

David can look at a sheet of music, and by reducing it into individual
parts, he can ﬁnd the right keys and play the song. Of course, this is a slow,
painstaking process that forces listeners to use their imagination when trying
to make out any semblance of melody.

After a month of lessons and regular practice, David becomes an advanced
beginner. By playing a song over and over, he goes beyond the note-by-note
struggle and begins to achieve some continuity of melody. Experience
improves his performance. He still sees the song as a series of notes on a
page, but begins to feel the ﬂow that allows a recognizable song to emerge.
David can play “Amazing Grace” so it actually sounds like “Amazing Grace”
and not some array of notes in random rhythm.

As the years go by, David reaches the third level and becomes a competent
pianist. Most musicians never pass this stage to become proﬁcient or expert.
He sees each song as a whole, a certain expression to be performed with a
deﬁnite goal in mind. He still plays by reading the notes, but he achieves
some degree of emotion and purpose in his playing.

An important distinction must be made here. David plays with the
emotion of the written expression in the piece (crescendos and fortes, etc.),
not with individual interpretation. He performs much like a machine that
very accurately converts the musical score into a sonata or concerto.

This level of competency can lead to excellent performances, for most
written music is thoroughly marked to show the composer’s emotion. These
marks have literal meaning, such as quiet (pianissimo), or pronounced and
sharp (staccato). David plays Bach’s “Prelude in E Minor” ﬂawlessly at a
recital and receives a standing ovation for his technical excellence.

However, David is still a person playing an instrument, much like a
computer running a complicated ﬂow chart. To advance to the next level,
proﬁciency, he must transcend the physical notes on paper (the rules) and
become deeply involved in the music.

To reach the fourth level and become proﬁcient, David must learn the
actual notes of a piece so well that he no longer has to think of them. The
written work becomes a part of his mind, a holistic image, allowing him to
interpret the music. This comes from experience—in life as well as hours of
practice at the keyboard. The pianist must rely on his intuitive ability to
express emotion through the piano, leaving behind the fact that the piece is

in E ﬂat in 6/8 time. Therefore, if David is proﬁcient, he will feel the
emotion that Bach created and, drawing on his own emotions and expe-
rience, convey that emotion in his playing.

Music that surpasses the competent level goes beyond the auditory
aesthetic and involves the listeners. Hearing a proﬁcient musician is often a
deeply moving experience, for passionate music arises from the emotion of
the performer and strikes similar chords in the listener. This cannot
be explained in rational terms, for one cannot teach the expression of
true emotion. Only through experience and involvement can proﬁciency
be reached.

The ﬁnal stage is labeled by Dreyfus and Dreyfus as expertise. David has
studied piano for many years and knows the instrument inside and out.
When he plays, the piano becomes an extension of his body. It is as if the
music comes straight from his mind, which in an important way it does.
He no longer thinks of individual notes or any rules when his hands are on
the keyboard.

An expert musician feels the melody, and the song lives as an expression
of his feeling. The mechanical aspects are fully ingrained, leaving the brain to
its wonderful powers of creation. Listening to an expert musician is like
peering into his thoughts and feeling the weight of his sadness or the
exhilaration of his joy. It is a mode of expression that transcends all rules and
calculative rationality to become pure expression. Few people reach the
expert level in any ﬁeld.

This example was meant to introduce you to the basic levels of skill
acquisition that we will attempt to take you through in learning to trade the
futures market successfully. However, learning is a process that requires a
great deal of time and effort, and learning to be an expert trader is no
exception. The musician spends many hours of rote memorization and
practice to develop experience and skill. Successful trading requires the same
discipline and hard work.

Many perceive futures trading to be a glamorous, high-proﬁt venture for
those with the nerve to trade and that, through the purchase of mechanical
systems and computer software, you can bypass the time and dedication it
takes to succeed in other professions.

In reality, there are few glamorous professions. Some, like the music
industry, reward the best quite impressively. It is easy for the naive music
lover to glamorize performers like Burt Bacharach, Frank Sinatra, and Billy
Joel. However, if we dig deep behind the sell-out stadium concerts and
multiplatinum albums, the music business is not much different than any

other profession. For every Simon and Garfunkel there are literally millions
of aspiring young musicians who spend endless hours of dedication and
frustration learning and perfecting their profession. Even the established
superstars spent uncounted days perfecting each song and their musical
ability to achieve recognition.

Because of the difﬁculty of making it big, many musicians burn out. The
process of becoming good enough to succeed brings with it the potential for
failure, and the process of becoming an expert trader is just as difﬁcult. The
learning in this book goes beyond technical systems into areas of self-
understanding that might reveal weakness in your abilities of self and market
observation, discipline, and objectivity. Also, much of the information in this
book differs from the accepted models of market analysis. Just as you will
learn that the best trades ﬂy in the face of the most recent market activity,
the information in this book ﬂies in the face of most current opinions and
theories on trading and understanding the market.

Futures trading is not a glamorous or proﬁtable experience for most of the
people who attempt to trade. Futures trading is a profession, and it takes as
much time and dedication to succeed as any other profession. You will start
as a beginner, learning the objective basics about the Proﬁle, then proceed
through the stages toward the ultimate goal of any professional in any
trade—becoming an expert.

Novice

Novice is the ﬁrst stage in any process. No one starts out an expert, or

even an advanced beginner. To learn any skill, you must begin by
learning the necessary objective facts and features—the tools with which
you will build your skill from the ground up. Just as a carpenter learns the
function of a saw, hammer, and plane before attempting to make his ﬁrst
basic bird feeder, you must learn the mechanics of the Market Proﬁle before
you make your ﬁrst basic market decisions.

The learning that occurs during the novice stage is largely rote memori-
zation. The carpenter is taught the workings of his tools; the aspiring pianist
is taught the deﬁnitions that form the base of all music theory. This learning
comes from a derivative source, such as a book or a teacher, and does not
involve the novice in any active way as he or she sits and listens or reads.
Some degree of derivative learning is necessary, especially during the early
stages, but in the words of the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “Much
learning does not teach understanding.” Only through experience and
extensive practice and application will understanding and expertise arise.
Throughout this book (a derivative source), there are many deﬁnitions
and patterns to memorize. It is important to remember, however, that the
information is only part of a larger whole that will develop as you read and
attempt to assimilate what you have learned with your personality,
individual trading style, and experience. Keep an open mind and actively
apply the new knowledge to your observations of the marketplace.

Perhaps some of your established beliefs have already been thrown into
question. In the example at the beginning of the book, Jim the yen trader is
torn between the different sources of information: fundamental, technical,
and market generated. All the fundamental sources (newspapers, trade

3GC02

05/13/2013

14:7:6

Page 8

magazines, personal advice) and technical sources (channel models, moving
averages, etc.) were predicting a rally in the foreign currencies. The market-
generated information, which is the market’s price activity recorded in
relation to time in a study with statistical curve, was indicating a market that
had reached the top of the up movement. This is not to say that all technical
gurus, ﬁnancial writers, and market analysts are useless—there is just no
greater indication of what the market is doing than the market itself!

The Market Proﬁle is a conduit for listening to the market. It is merely a graph
that plots time on one axis and price on the other to give a visual impression
of market activity. This representation takes the form of a statistical bell
curve, just like your high school teacher used. Most students scored in the
middle of the bell curve with Cs, while fewer received As and Fs. Similarly,
the majority of a day’s transactional volume takes place in a common range
of prices, with less trading on the day’s extremes (see Figure 2.1).

The Market Proﬁle is simply a way of organizing market activity as it unfolds. It is
not a system that predicts tops and bottoms or trend continuation any more
than the teacher’s grade chart is an indicator of overall student intelligence.

The Market Proﬁle is an evolving gauge that accurately reﬂects market
activity in the present tense, a gauge being deﬁned as a passive device that
exists only to measure something. The key to the Market Proﬁle lies in
correctly reading this information.

The statistical bell curve is employed to allow us to visualize what a graph
might look like that plots time, a constant, on the horizontal axis against
price, a variable, on the vertical axis. Scientists have employed this method
of analysis for generations. Its utilization in market analysis creates a
distribution curve that allows us to organize the data and better understand
the continuous two-way auction process. The graph of the Market Proﬁle is
seldom bell shaped; there is, more often, a skew to the Proﬁle. However,
this fact does not detract from its value as a teaching tool to understand the
foundational principle of the Market Proﬁle.

& Laying the Foundation

In this section, we will discuss the deﬁnitions and concepts that form the
foundation for learning to understand the market through the Market Proﬁle.
As has been stated before, this is a challenging task. Everything you learn
about the Market Proﬁle is interrelated and integral to a complete under-
standing of the market. Each concept is like a piece in an intricate puzzle that
should be studied to determine its place in the developing picture. If you ﬁle
each piece away as a separately deﬁned deﬁnition, you will be left with a
jumble of seemingly unrelated facts. But, if you continually integrate each
section of the book with what you have already learned, the picture will
slowly emerge.

The Auction

Jim Kelvin intuitively knew that the bull trend in the yen was over because of
his days in the ranching business. At ﬁrst glance, the futures market seems to
have very little to do with cattle ranching. However, they are both markets,
and all markets share a common auction process through which trade is
conducted.

As Jim Kelvin sat before his quote monitor on that morning, he recalled
one of the last days he took his livestock to auction. Price for feeder cattle
had been steadily climbing for several months, reaching a high of 86 cents,
but the number of steers sold had fallen signiﬁcantly during the previous
week’s auction. The meat processers had cut back their purchasing to the

3GC02

05/13/2013

14:7:7

Page 10

bare minimum at higher prices, buying just enough to keep their processing
plants operating and to meet their contract obligations. Jim knew that price
would have to auction lower to ﬁnd renewed buying.

A steer was led into the auction barn. The sale barn manager at one end of
the circular corral called out the starting price, “Do I hear 80 cents for this
ﬁne feeder steer?” The opening call was too high and did not get a raise from
the men standing around the perimeter of the circle. “78? . . . 76? . . . Do
I hear 74 cents?” Finally, a buyer entered the auction, starting the bidding at
72 cents. After a small rally as buyers called out their offers, the steer was
sold at 76 cents a pound. The up auction over the last few months in the
cattle market had ended. Price had to auction lower to attract buyers.

During some auctions there would be an immediate response to the
opening bid, and price would move up quickly. “Do I hear 82? I have an offer
for 82 . . . Do I hear 84? . . . 85?” as the men around the perimeter of the
ring cried out their offers.

Other times, the initial price would be too high, and the auctioneer would
quickly lower the bid, “Do I hear 78? . . . 77? . . . 76 for this ﬁne steer?”
The price would back off until a buyer entered the auction, then price would
begin to move upward, often auctioning beyond the opening price. Once
the auction got started, competition and anxiety among buyers sometimes
drove the market beyond the prices that were initially rejected as too high.
Price would continue up until only one buyer remained. “Ninety-two going
once, twice, three times . . . sold,” then the auction was over.

The futures market auctions in a similar manner. If the open is considered
below value, price auctions higher in search of sellers. If the open is
considered too high by the market’s participants, price auctions lower,
searching for buyers. Once a buyer enters the market, price begins to auction
upward until the last buyer has bought. Similarly, the market auctions
downward until the last seller has sold, constantly searching for information.
As you progress through this book, the importance of the market’s
auction process will become evident. And, with the aid of the Market
Proﬁle, you will soon see that the futures market’s auction process is by no
means a random walk.

Organizing the Day
The basic building blocks of the Market Proﬁle are called Time Price
Opportunities, or TPOs. Each half hour of the trading day is designated by a
letter. If a certain price is traded during a given half hour, the corresponding

letter, or TPO, is marked next to the price. Figure 2.2 shows each half-hour
segment separately alongside the completed proﬁle. On a side note,
Treasury bonds trade in 32nds of $1,000, and one tick is worth $31.25
($1,000 divided by 32). In the bond market on this day, the prices traded
during the ﬁrst 30 minutes (A period) ranged from 9629/32 to 9710/32.
The next time period (B period) traded from 9631/32 to 974/32, and so on.
The resulting Proﬁle is shown in Figure 2.2.

We will now proceed through the same day in the bonds step-by-step,
explaining in detail how to read the basic information generated by the
market through the Market Proﬁle “gauge.” The numbers in the following
discussion refer to Figure 2.3.
1. The price range resulting from market activity during the ﬁrst two time
periods (the ﬁrst hour) for most commodities is called the initial balance

(slightly longer in the S&P). In the Treasury bond example shown in
Figure 2.3, the initial balance was established from 9629/32 to 9710/32
by the ﬂoor traders, or locals, during A and B periods. The initial
balance represents the period of time in which the locals attempt to ﬁnd
a range where two-sided trade can take place—a range where both the
buyer and seller agree to conduct trade. Locals trade mostly in the day
timeframe and provide liquidity, not direction, in the market by acting

3GC02

05/13/2013

14:7:7

Page 13

as middlemen between the off-ﬂoor traders. Their purpose is not to
make one or two big trades every day, but to make a few ticks on a large
volume of trades. The local is typically responsible for over 50 percent
of the day’s trading volume.

The local’s role is like a car dealer—a middleman between the
producer and consumer. The dealer’s goal is to move his inventory
quickly to make a small proﬁt on each sale. He must buy from the
producer, like General Motors, at a price he ﬁnds fair, then turn around
and sell to the consumer at a price that will attract buying while
maintaining a degree of proﬁt. The local on the ﬂoor of the exchange acts
in the same way, buying from long-term sellers and selling to long-term
buyers, who only enter the market when they feel price is away from
value. We will refer to the long-term market participants as the “other”
timeframe, for long term is a highly subjective concept and can represent
a trade that spans anywhere from several days (sometimes called a swing
trade) to several months. “Other” separates the traders whose partici-
pation spans more than one day from the locals, who operate solely in the
shortest timeframe. The importance of the other timeframe participants
will be discussed at greater length throughout the book, for it is the other
timeframe activity that moves and shapes the market, just as General
Motors and the consumer shape the automotive market. Understanding
what the other timeframe is doing is vital in successfully trading the
futures market.

2. In D period, the other timeframe seller enters the market and extends
the range down to 9625/32. Any movement in price beyond the initial
balance set up by the local in the ﬁrst hour of trading is called range
extension, and signiﬁes that something has changed because of other
timeframe buyer or seller presence. The local is not responsible for
any major moves in the market. It is the other timeframe that can move
price substantially.

Again, in D period, it is evident that the other timeframe seller
entered the market and extended the range on the down side. Either
the other timeframe buyer will respond to these lower prices, or
the other timeframe seller will continue to auction price lower in search
of buyers.

3. The responsive buyer did enter the market around 9624/32, and price
balanced around the lower portion of the day’s range until K period.
An hour before the market’s close, the other timeframe seller probed

Page 14

downward once again beginning with the K print at 9625/32 and
extending down to 9617/32, but was met by the buyer responding
to lower prices, forcing price back to close in the middle of the range.
4. The range refers to the entire height of the Proﬁle—from the high to the

low. On this day range was 9617/32 to 9710/32.

5. All activity below the initial balance is other timeframe seller range
extension (just as all activity above the initial balance is other timeframe
buyer range extension). Any activity above 9710/32 or below 9629/32 is
range extension on this day.

6. The area where 70 percent of the day’s business is conducted (roughly
one standard deviation) is called the value area. This is logical, for the
middle part of the bell curve is where most activity occurs and indicates
two-sided trade took place in the day timeframe. Similarly, in a
teacher’s grading curve, most students score in the middle ranges,
which is reﬂected in the wider middle area of the bell curve. If both
buyer and seller are actively participating in an area, then that area is
accepted as value by both parties. On July 25 in the bonds, value was
accepted between 9624/32 and 973/32. The value area can be easily
calculated using TPOs or actual price/volume ﬁgures. A sample
calculation of the value area is shown in Appendix 1.

7. The single K TPOs at the lower extreme of the Proﬁle are called a
single-print buying tail. This is an important reference point, for it
indicates that the other timeframe buyer responded strongly to price
advertised below value, rejecting price out of the lower range in one
time period (K). Competition among buyers for contracts causes price
to move quickly. Therefore, the longer the tail, the stronger the other
timeframe activity. A tail occurring during the last period of the day is
not technically a tail, for it cannot be validated by rejection in
subsequent time periods. In addition, a tail must be at least two
TPOs long to have any real signiﬁcance.

8. The four single A prints at the top of the day’s range are a single-print
selling tail. This tail shares the same signiﬁcance as the other timeframe
buying tail in K period. The other timeframe seller reacted to higher
prices, quickly moving price lower. Attempts to auction beyond the
single-print tail by trading up into that price range in subsequent
time periods (C and D) met strong resistance, showing seller strength
at those prices.

9. The longest line of TPOs closest to the center of the range is called the
point of control. This is the price where the most activity occurred during

the day, and it is therefore the fairest price in the day timeframe. The
greatest amount of time was spent trading at that price, signifying
greatest value. This concept will be further developed later, for it is of
great importance in monitoring other timeframe activity in the day
timeframe.

10. M period denotes the closing range, which is the market’s last indication
of overall sentiment for the day. It is used as a reference point against the
following day’s open to see if the underlying market sentiment has
changed.

Challenging the Rules

You should now have a feel for reading the basic indicators of the Market
Proﬁle. Many concepts were introduced, some undoubtedly foreign to the
opinions you were taught and the rules you learned about the futures
market. Roger von Oech, author of A Whack on the Side of the Head,
challenges the power of the rules.

. . . there is a lot of pressure in our culture to follow the rules. This
value is one of the ﬁrst things we learn as children. We are told,
“Don’t color out-side the lines,” and “No orange elephants.” Our
educational system encourages further rule-following. Students are
usually better rewarded for regurgitating information than for
playing with ideas and thinking of original uses for things. As a
consequence, people feel more comfortable following rules than
challenging them.

Challenging the rules is a good creative thinking strategy, but that’s
not all. Never challenging the rules brings with it . . . potential
dangers.1

Understanding the Market Proﬁle requires more than the regurgitation of
a list of concepts; it requires the ability to challenge the rules and look
beyond the restricting conﬁnes of popular opinion. Look over the basics we
just covered again. David had to know the basics of the music score before he
could successfully play “Amazing Grace.”

The Role of the Marketplace
Consider the purpose of the market for a moment. Most traders don’t take
the time to understand the very foundation of the market they are trying to
master. The carpenter could not build a functional birdhouse if he never
stopped to ask himself “Just what is the purpose of a birdhouse?” The reason
for this basic oversight is directly related to von Oech’s challenge of the
rules. Most people do not want to know the purpose of the market. They do
not want to have to think rationally and objectively about the bigger picture.
Most market participants, in fact most people in general, would rather be
given a set of rules to blindly follow than to have to use personal insight and
innovative thought. Again, the majority of the people who trade futures do
not make money.

The purpose of the futures market is similar to any other market. It exists
solely to facilitate trade, and it does so by auctioning from high to low and low
to high, in order to ﬁnd an area where trade can best be facilitated.

Think of trade facilitation in terms of your corner grocery store. If the
price of peanut butter is too high, shoppers will refrain from buying, and
the grocer will realize that price is too high. He will then move price
lower until the buyer responds by purchasing the product. If the grocer
moves price too low, however, his inventory will be quickly depleted as
buyers take advantage of price below value. Finally, the price will balance
somewhere in between the two extremes, where value is established and
two-sided trade can take place. Price must move too high or too low
before both the grocer and the shopper know it has gone far enough. The
same is true in the futures market. The market auctions up until the buyer
will buy no more, and down until the seller will sell no more, in the
process establishing extremes of price, shown in the proﬁle as the tapering
ends of the bell curve.

Now imagine that Figure 2.3 is a proﬁle of the grocer’s peanut butter
sales over the period of several months, instead of Treasury bond sales (in
theory, not actual price and individual TPOs). Initially, the price was set too
high, and there were no buyers to generate sales. The grocer then quickly
lowered the price to move his inventory, as shown in the A period single-
print selling tail (see point 1 in Figure 2.3). Price went too low in that same
period and buyers bought heavily, allowing the grocer to move prices back
up in B and C periods. The extremes of price seemed to have been established
in A period, and value was accepted somewhere in the middle. In D period,
however, another seller entered the market, a supermarket chain two

blocks away. The larger store could afford to charge lower prices, so the
local grocer had to cut costs to stay in business. In the following weeks, value
was established near the bottom of the previous lower extreme—value was
accepted lower because of stronger sellers. Finally, the local grocer decided
to do a promotional “peanut butter extravaganza” and substantially lowered
price to attract shoppers. The ploy worked, as shown by the strong buying
tail in K period. The buyers responded to lower prices, allowing the grocer
to raise them to a proﬁtable level once again.

This comparison is intended to bring home the similarity of the trade
facilitation process in all markets. The futures market is a constant auction
looking for a balance between the two major forces behind market
movement: the other timeframe buyer and seller.

Let us look at the role of the other timeframe within the marketplace
from another perspective for a moment. Looking at something in a different
light often brings valuable insight. If Gutenberg had never looked at a wine
press as something entirely different, we might not have the printing press
today and you would be reading a manual handwritten by a scrivener (and
paid a lot more for it). Imagine the other timeframe seller and the other
timeframe buyer as two distinct personalities, two separate entities who
stand on opposite sides of a game board in the shape of an exchange pit. They
both have their ﬁngers on big buttons; one says “sell” and the other “buy.” In
the pit are miniature locals, yelling and gesturing as they do their trades.
Other timeframe participants are battling for market control, and they enter
the market when they feel price has gotten away from value or some
external information convinces them to act. For example, a signiﬁcant news
event might cause the other timeframe buyer to enter the market and drive
price upward for the entire day.

This example is obviously only an imaginative idea, but the other
timeframe participants often do act as if they were individuals, and it is
not always possible to tell why they enter the market. The point is, to
successfully trade the futures market, you must understand what the other
timeframe is doing and position yourself with them.

Going with the Crowd

In a classic Candid Camera TV show, a man waits for an elevator. When it
arrives, everyone on it is facing the back of the elevator, so he gets on and
faces backward also. If you blindly follow the majority, you will usually be

going the wrong way. As we said before, the majority of market participants
do not make money.

This is a pretty bold statement, but if you stop and think about how
many times the big name analysts have been plain wrong, it doesn’t seem
so far fetched. Nonetheless, when the big movers on the Street talk,
most everybody listens—it is much easier to dogmatically rely on an
expert than to be a rugged individualist who makes his own decisions.
When you rely solely on yourself, you alone take pride in reaping the
rewards of success—but there is also no one else to blame for defeat.
The tendency to be a follower is not an easy thing to realize or admit.
Not surprisingly, one of the primary reasons many traders use a technical
(mechanical) trading system is to take themselves out of the decision-
making process.

These are but a few thoughts to keep in the back of your mind as we
continue through the Novice stage and discuss more labels and terms. Again,
the Market Proﬁle is not a technical or mechanical system, and the discussion
to follow should not be memorized for later “regurgitation.” Remember,
everything is a part of the larger whole, and “a little information is a
dangerous thing.”

Organizing the day began with a discussion of initial balance; initial
balance represented the period of time where local traders (i.e., ﬂoor
traders) searched for a range where two-sided trade would take place.
Locals traded mostly in the day timeframe and provided liquidity. Floor
trader daily volume often averaged over 50 percent of day timeframe
activity; the ﬂoor trader attempted to get in-between every trade; they
attempted to buy from the seller and sell to the buyer. The importance of
ﬂoors has continually diminished as off-ﬂoor, electronic, screen-based
trading has evolved.

When ﬂoors were more of an integral part of trading I looked at the base
that developed during the initial balance for early guidance; the broader the
base the more stable the market was likely to be.

Electronic trading has provided far more transparency for traders; traders
can now view volume at every price. Off-ﬂoor traders still attempt to make
markets, which increases liquidity.

Another improvement is the faster dissemination of news; when ﬂoors
were more dominant and news was slower to reach non-ﬂoor traders the
locals had another advantage.

Initial balance today is slightly more ambiguous; however, it still

represents early morning market activity.

& Introduction to Day Timeframe Structure

When the local grocer priced his peanut butter below value in the “peanut
butter extravaganza,” the consumer bought in a frenzy, leaving in its wake a
single-print buying tail. Tails are an important piece of information in the
anatomy of a Market Proﬁle, for they indicate the presence of the other
timeframe buyer or seller. A tail is an identiﬁable characteristic with deﬁnite
implications. Whenever you see that particular pattern, you associate it with
a speciﬁc set of facts, just as a linebacker learns, through experience, that
certain formations indicate what the offense is going to do. On a bigger scale,
the Market Proﬁle as a whole tends to fall into readable patterns in the day
timeframe, determined by the degree of involvement of the other timeframe
participant. These patterns, when properly identiﬁed, can increase the day
trader’s success, as well as provide information regarding what the market is
trying to do in the longer term.

The labels we will give these patterns are not as important as understanding
how the day evolves in relation to the initial balance and the conﬁdence with
which the other timeframe has entered the market. Think of the initial balance
as a base for the day’s trading. The purpose of a base is to provide support for
something, as the base of a lamp keeps the lamp from tipping over. The
narrower the base, the easier it is to knock the lamp over. The same principle
holds true for futures trading in the day timeframe. If the initial balance is
narrow, the odds are greater that the base will be upset and range extension
will occur. Days that establish a wider base provide more support and the
initial balance is more likely to maintain the extremes for the day.

If you think of the other timeframe as a single personality, as in the game
board analogy, it is possible to judge the activity of all the other timeframe
buyers or sellers according to their level of “conﬁdence.” Each day type is the
result of varying degrees and forms of other timeframe activity, and this
activity tends to fall into certain patterns. Keep these broader concepts of
base and conﬁdence in mind as we examine the six day types.

& Normal Day
Dynamics
The label “Normal day” is misleading, for in reality, “Normal” days are more the
exception than the rule. Normal days are generally created by swift early entry
of the other timeframe participant, which has the effect of establishing a wide

initial balance. Thereafter, both the other timeframe buyer and seller auction
price back and forth between them, as balanced, two-sided trade ensues.

Normal days are often caused by a news announcement early in the
trading session that triggers a strong other timeframe reaction, driving price

3GC02

Page 21

quickly in one direction. For example, suppose that a bearish economic
indicator released shortly after the open causes the other timeframe seller
to aggressively enter the market and drive price lower. Eventually, price
moves low enough to attract other timeframe buying, thus cutting off the
selling activity. For the remainder of the day, there is little strong directional
conviction and price balances between the extremes. An example of a
Normal day is shown in Figure 2.4.

Structural Characteristics

The primary characteristic of a Normal day is the wide initial balance, or
base, that is not upset throughout the day. In Treasury bonds in Figure 2.4,
the initial balance was established in A and B periods from 964/32 to
—well over a point wide. Other timeframe sellers entered on the
9714/32
upper extreme because price auctioned too high, creating a strong single-
print selling tail, while other timeframe buyers entered on the lower
extreme as price auctioned too low, creating a single-print buying tail. Price
spent the rest of the day auctioning within the extremes.

On the surface, Normal days might appear easy to trade. However,
imagine the anxiety in placing an order to buy just after price has dropped
over a point! The bottom appears to be literally dropping out of the market,
and you have to pick up that phone and say “buy it.” This is not to say that
every time a market drops a point you should step up and buy—that would
be ﬁnancial suicide. But as we proceed through the more common day types
and you observe them through your own experience, you will begin to
develop an understanding of which day timeframe patterns and logical
market situations will give you the conﬁdence to buy against such a break.
We bring this up primarily to touch on two key principles that you will no
doubt grow tired of by the end of this book. They are:

The best trades often ﬂy in the face of the most recent market activity, and never

lose sight of the bigger picture.

& Normal Variation of a Normal Day
Dynamics

A Normal Variation of a Normal day is characterized by market activity early
in the trading session that is less dynamic than that of a Normal day. As the day
progresses, however, the other timeframe enters the market and substantially

extends the range. It is as if the other timeframe participant had watched the
auctions for a while, then decided price was opportune and entered
aggressively. The other timeframe’s conviction is more evident, due to range
extension on this type of day (compared to a Normal day). In Figure 2.5,
the other timeframe seller auctioned price downward in D period until the
other timeframe buyer responded to lower prices and cut off the selling.

Page 23

For the remainder of the day, trade is two-sided and a new area of balance
is established.

Structural Characteristics

Normal Variations typically do not have quite as wide of an initial balance as
Normal days (point 1 in Figure 2.5). The initial balance, or base, is upset on
one side by other timeframe range extension, usually early in the day. In
Figure 2.5, the other timeframe seller extended the range down in D period,
“tipping over” the base to the downside (point 2). For the duration of the
day, the market’s auction process involves the other timeframe buyer, other
timeframe seller, and the local (referred to as two-timeframe trade). On this
day, selling range extension causes value to be established lower (point 3).

& Trend Day
Dynamics

There are two types of Trend days: the standard Trend day and the Double-
Distribution Trend day. The most important feature of a standard Trend
day is the high level of directional conﬁdence that is evident throughout the
day. The other timeframe buyer or seller remains in control of the auction
process virtually from the day’s open to its close. In addition, as a Trend
auctions higher or lower, it continues to draw new business into the
market, thus creating unidirectional, sustained price movement fueled by
higher volume.

V

Structural Characteristics

On a Trend day, the open forms the upper or lower extreme in the large
majority of cases (point 1 in Figure 2.6), because the other timeframe is
usually in control from the opening bell. In the Trend day example in
Figure 2.6, the other timeframe seller extends the range downward during
multiple time periods, remaining in control for the entire day (points 2 and
3). Such unidirectional activity is referred to as a “one-timeframe” market.
During a one-timeframe buying Trend day, each time period will auction to
a higher (or equal) price level without auctioning below the previous time
period’s lows. Conversely, in a one-timeframe selling Trend day, each
additional time period will equal or extend below previous periods without

auctioning above the previous period’s highs. For example, in Figure 2.6, E
period extended below D on the downside, thus extending the range to
begin the trend day. Then G auctioned lower than E (without auctioning
above the E period high), H lower than G, J lower than L, and so on.

3GC02

05/13/2013

14:7:10

Page 25

One-timeframe conditions are a good indication of other timeframe control
and a potential Trend day.

A Trend day differs from a Normal Variation day in that the Trend day’s
Proﬁle is generally thinner and more elongated, usually no more than four
or ﬁve TPOs wide at any point. Failure to recognize and accept that one is
in a Trend day is one of the most costly mistakes a trader can make.
Several days of trading proﬁts can be lost in one trading session if you are
positioned against the trend. It is important to identify early that either the
other timeframe buyer or seller is in clear control and position yourself
with them.

& Double-Distribution Trend Day
Dynamics

The second type of Trend day, the Double-Distribution Trend day, is
relatively inactive during the ﬁrst few hours of the trading session. Market
participants possess a low level of conviction, resulting in a narrow base.
Later in the session, a change in events causes the other timeframe to
perceive price to be unfair at current price levels, enter the market
aggressively, and substantially extend the range. This later entry by the
other timeframe drives price to a new level, where a second balance region
develops. The Double-Distribution Trend day does not possess the steady
conﬁdence of a typical Trend day and must stop and reassure itself after a
substantial move.

Structural Characteristics
A very small initial balance is the ﬁrst indication of a potential Double-
Distribution Trend day. Again, the more narrow the base, the easier it is
to overwhelm this area and auction quickly to a new level (point 1 in
Figure 2.7). In Figure 2.7, the other timeframe seller extends the range
down in F and G periods (point 2). Lower prices are accepted as value forms
below the original value area in a new distribution, separated by single TPO
price prints (point 3). This new trading range generally holds throughout the
day, often providing useful reference points and good trading opportunities
for day traders.

end of the day. If price auctions back into the single prints during the latter
time periods, in effect making them double prints, something has changed,
and the second distribution is no longer accepted as value. For example, in
the Double-Distribution Trend in Figure 2.7, a price probe into the F period

single prints (point 4) would indicate that a strong other timeframe buyer
had entered, or that the other timeframe seller conviction that caused the
initial range extension is no longer present.

& Nontrend Day
Dynamics

A Nontrend day is characterized by a complete lack of directional convic-
tion. Nontrend days often occur before the release of a big economic
number, a news event, or a holiday. Market participants balance their
positions in expectation of the market’s reaction to the external stimuli—
there is simply no activity. Trade is not being facilitated in any direction, for
there is little market participation and no conﬁdence.

Structural Characteristics

A Nontrend day starts out looking as if it might be a Trend day, for the initial
range is narrow. However, the other timeframe never surfaces and there is
no range extension. The market is waiting for new information before
making its next directional move. A typical Nontrend day in Treasury bonds
is shown in Figure 2.8.

& Neutral Day
Dynamics

When a Neutral day occurs, it means that the other timeframe buyer and
seller are not far apart in their view of value. When they have similar views
of value, the market balances, auctioning back and forth between them.
During a Neutral day, both other timeframe participants are present (if only
one were active, there would be an imbalance and a Trend or Normal
Variation type of day would occur).

It is important to keep in mind that while the other timeframe buyer and
seller may be close in their perception of value, they rarely agree on the
same price, just as the automobile producer rarely agrees with the long-term
car buyers. Therefore, the other timeframe buyer and seller do not trade
with each other, they trade with the local—the middleman.

Structural Characteristics

On a Neutral day, the base width is somewhere between a Trend and Normal
day. It is not so small as to be easily upset and not wide enough to hold the
day’s extremes (point 1 in Figure 2.9). The salient feature on a Neutral day
is the fact that both the other timeframe buyer and the other timeframe
seller are active, as is evidenced by range extension on both sides of the initial
balance (points 2 and 3). This indicates a market in balance (point 4), for all
timeframes are involved.

There are two types of Neutral days: Neutral-center and Neutral-extreme.
On a Neutral-center day, the day closes with price in the middle of the range,

indicating a lack of conﬁdence and a balance between the other timeframe
buyer and seller. On a Neutral-extreme day, price closes on either the high or
low extreme for the day, indicating a hypothetical “victory” in the day
timeframe battle for control between the other timeframe buyer and seller.

3GC02

05/13/2013

14:7:12

Page 31

If the day closes on the upper extreme on a Neutral day, then the other
timeframe buyer has higher directional conviction. Conversely, if the close is
on the lows, the other timeframe seller has exhibited greater conﬁdence.

& Day Type Summary

The chart in Figure 2.10 displays the type of day on the horizontal axis and
the level of directional conviction that the day exhibits on the vertical axis.
The result is a gradually ascending line from lowest conviction to highest,
from a Nontrend day to a Trend day. Again, the labels we have given the day
types are not carved in stone, but are used only for learning purposes. What
should become clear is that by monitoring a day’s conviction very early in
the trading session, traders can quickly begin to understand and visualize
how the day will develop.

At this point you know the basic “objective facts and features” about the
Market Proﬁle. Like David the novice piano player, you have learned
the foundation for further learning, but there is a long way to go. In the
following sections, the concepts you have learned as a novice will serve as
the foundation for understanding the market, like the staff and notes are the
foundation for understanding music.

Remember to actively interpret and combine your new knowledge with
your experience in the market. Do not put the facts you have learned as a
novice away and say, “Okay, what’s next?” The learning process is an ongoing
synthesis, each part ﬁtting into the next like a puzzle. Trying to become an
expert trader without a continuum between the stages is like trying to put
together a puzzle with all the pieces the same color. Look for the big picture.

When David reached the advanced beginner stage, he could play a

few simple songs all the way through. Then his instructor gave him
a new song to learn that was in a different key signature, explaining that
certain notes are raised and must be played on the black keys. When
David tried to play it, he became frustrated and exclaimed, “This song
doesn’t work.”

He was playing every note as it was written, the way he had learned as
a novice. The instructor calmly explained that in any key signature besides
C major, certain notes must be played differently.

David fell victim to tunnel vision, for he was thinking only of the limited
rules he had memorized and was not incorporating the new information in
his playing. He then blamed the written music to explain his failure and
frustration. The musical score is not right or wrong; it is only a passive
medium that communicates a certain piece of music.

Tunnel vision is an easy trap to fall into, especially when learning large
amounts of new information. It is not uncommon to hear beginning Market
Proﬁle traders comment, “The Proﬁle doesn’t work.” There is nothing
about the Proﬁle that does or does not work. It is only a passive gauge of
market-generated information—a way to organize the data, much like the
musical score. What fails to work is the trader’s ability to see the big picture
objectively and realize that everything is a series of facts surrounded by other
circumstances. Only when all the circumstances are interpreted together
and a holistic image develops will successful trading occur.

& Building the Framework

In Advanced Beginner, we will begin to build upon the foundation
established in Novice. You will learn many of the broad concepts that
will serve as tools for building a framework for understanding the market-
place through the Market Proﬁle.

& The Big Picture: Market Structure, Trading
Logic, and Time

The big picture is made up of three broad categories of information: market
structure, trading logic, and time. As a novice you learned the basics of
market structure, the most tangible information offered by the Market
Proﬁle in the unique bell curve graphic. Very short-term structure is
reﬂected through time price opportunities (TPOs) and the market’s half-
hour auctions. As the day progresses, the market begins to form one of the
day types through range extension, tails, etc. We can see, measure, and
name the physical aspects of the Proﬁle. By the day’s end, structure shows
not only what happened, but also when it happened and who was involved.
In short, market structure provides visible evidence of the actions and
behavior of the market’s participants. In this section, this structural evidence
will be built upon and combined with time and trading logic.

Time is the market’s regulator. In its broadest sense, time sets limitations
on the day’s trading by imposing a certain framework (i.e., the number of
hours from the open to the close). Most traders see time only in its function
of the closing bell, and do not consider its inﬂuence on price and
opportunity. Without considering time, there is no way to judge value,
and trading becomes a 50/50 gamble on price movement.

In the day timeframe, time validates price. The areas of the Market
Proﬁle’s bell curve showing the greatest depth indicate the prices where
trading spent the most time, thus establishing value for that day (price (cid:1)
time ¼ value).1 Understanding value and value area will become more and
more important as we progress through the learning process.

Time also regulates opportunity. Consider an everyday life example. You
are in the market to buy a pair of snow skis. You shop around long enough to
get a good feel as to how much skis normally cost or what you consider

value. You don’t need the skis right away, so you wait for a chance to buy
them under value—you are a long-term buyer.

You know that after the ski season ends, most stores will have summer ski
clearance sales, when price will temporarily drop below value. You also
know that these prices will not last long, for time regulates opportunity. The
stores could not afford to sell at such low prices all year and still make a
proﬁt. They are merely clearing excess inventory in preparation for new
stock. To take advantage of the low price, you must act quickly.

The same principle is true in the futures market. Good opportunities to
buy below value or sell above value will not last long, for price will move
quickly with increased competition. If price stays below value for a long
time, for example, it is no longer a good opportunity. Something has
changed, and value is being accepted lower.

The third and most difﬁcult category is trading logic. Trading logic is
largely a product of experience, but it is more than just careful observation
and practice; it is an understanding of why the market behaves the way it
does. This understanding is best gained over time and through a conscious
effort to understand the forces behind market movement. Certain aspects of
trading logic can be taught in relation to structure and time, by derivative
learning. For example, you know that a tail is an indicator of strong other
timeframe activity on the extremes. If the tail is “taken out” by a price
rotation back into the tail and TPOs build over time, trading logic says that
something has changed, and the other timeframe buyer or seller that moved
price quickly is no longer present or is less willing to respond to the same
price levels.

The only way to really understand the market and its logic is to observe,
interpret, and trade. Remember, much learning does not teach under-
standing. We will be integrating trading logic throughout the remainder of
the book.

A Synthesis: Structure, Time, and Logic

Imagine two children, each racing to complete a giant jigsaw puzzle.
Both are working on the same puzzle with an equal number of pieces (the
same structure), but one child has a picture of the ﬁnished puzzle and one
does not. Obviously, the child with knowledge of the whole picture will
ﬁnish ﬁrst.

The Proﬁle graphic is much like an intricate puzzle. Its structure reveals
more and more as the day nears completion. But, like the child with a

picture of the ﬁnished puzzle, traders with an understanding of the big
picture—those that can see the market develop before it is revealed by
structure—are generally the ﬁrst to put together the pieces of the market.
Market time and trading logic are the two big-picture components of a
whole-market understanding. Only through a synthesis of all three compo-
nents will a trader successfully put together the puzzle. We will now discuss
market structure, time, and trading logic according to ﬁve general criteria:
1. Ease of learning
2. Amount of information
3. Recognition speed
4. Trade location
5. Conﬁdence level

Ease of Learning Ironically, the order in which structure, time, and logic
are usually learned is opposite from their order of occurrence in the
marketplace—not because they are taught incorrectly, but rather because
market structure is learned more quickly and easily than the roles of time
and logic. Market structure is the ﬁnished product, and it is always easier to
see the ﬁnished product than to identify the stages of
its assembly.
Mastering market structure is largely a matter of successfully recognizing
and interpreting the Proﬁle graphic. Understanding the role of time,
however, requires a much deeper understanding of the market’s auction
process. Trading logic is the hardest to learn, particularly from a book or
instructor, for logic is the ultimate outcome of trading practice and
experience. Trading logic is the raw human instinct of the marketplace.
True trading logic comes only through intensive participation and careful
examination of real market situations.

Amount of Information While market structure is clearly the most
tangible information offered by the Proﬁle, it also contains the greatest
amount and variety of information. Why, then, is it so difﬁcult to interpret
market structure in real trading situations? It is relatively simple to recognize
and interpret the day’s ﬁnal structure. The difﬁculty lies in recognizing what
is transpiring as the structures are building.

The inability to identify a developing structure does not necessarily mean
that the information is lacking. It is simply not conveyed in an easily readable
format. In addition, it is possible to monitor the wrong information. Market
time and trading logic provide very little in terms of visible, tangible
information—but the information is in the market. Successful trading

requires the ability to ﬁnd and interpret the more subtle clues found in time
and logic, and integrate them with the developing structure.

Recognition Speed It takes time to build structure. Thus, while the
Proﬁle structure reveals a lot, the sheer fact that time must transpire
suggests that fundamental changes occur in the market before they are
revealed by structure. Structure acts as the market’s translator, and
translated information is second-hand information. The market has already
spoken in the form of time and logic. Traders who rely exclusively on
structure without integrating time and logic will be late in entering and
exiting the market, just as a catcher who holds his throw until he sees how
fast a man stealing second base can run will never make the out.

Trade Location Later recognition leads to later entry and exit, which in turn
leads to less desirable trade location. For example, range extension (structure)
conﬁrms that other timeframe buyers have entered the market. But when did
they enter the market? If we rely solely on structure, we do not realize the other
timeframe buyer’s point of entry until the point of range extension—that is,
when price is on the day’s high. Buying the high results in poor day timeframe
trade location, at least temporarily. In many cases, it is possible to know that
buyers are assuming control before the actual structural conﬁrmation (range
extension) through an understanding of market time and trading logic.

Conﬁdence Level Trading based on structure provides the greatest level
of comfort and conﬁdence, for there is obvious proof on which to base a
decision. The more information we have in our favor, the more comfortable
we are with a trade. Unfortunately, visible information and opportunity are
inversely related. The more structural information present, the less an
opportunity still exists. Thus, if a trader waits for too much information,
chances are good that the real opportunity has been missed. If all the
evidence is present and visible, then you are far from the ﬁrst to have acted
on it and probably have poor trade location.

Market time, followed by trading logic, provides the least amount of
visible evidence. To the advanced beginner trader, trades based on time and
logic offer a lower level of conﬁdence, for the trader is not yet comfortable
outside the realm of structure. Seasoned traders with a whole-market
understanding, on the other hand, trade using logic and time and then
monitor activity for the additional information (structure) necessary to
increase their conﬁdence in the trade.

Summary Logic creates the impetus, time generates the signal, and structure
provides the conﬁrmation.

The preceding discussion delineates

the many differences among
structure, time, and logic, but the answer to a practical sense of their
synthesis must be developed through time and experience. Such coordina-
tion is gained only through observing and acting on market-generated
information every day (doing the trade). Although the Market Proﬁle is best
known for the Proﬁle graphic, or structure, experience has shown that
understanding the inﬂuence of time and trading logic is more important to
reaching a holistic view of the marketplace. Putting in the extra effort to
fully understand the building blocks of structure—market time and trading
logic—will better prepare traders to anticipate and take advantage of trading
opportunities as they develop, not after they have passed.

& Evaluating Other Timeframe Control

We have stressed in general terms the importance of determining who, if
anyone, is in control of the market. Let us now enter into evaluating other
timeframe control in a more detailed, conclusive discussion. The elements
that signify other timeframe control are perhaps the most deceptive of all
market-generated information we will cover. Often, information that we
believe we are interpreting objectively is presented in such a way that its
actual nature is misinterpreted.

An example of such an illusion often occurs when a market opens
exceptionally above the previous day’s value area. The other timeframe
seller responds to the higher open, enters the market aggressively, and
auctions price lower all day. However, at the conclusion of the trading
session, the day’s value is ultimately higher. In the day timeframe, other
timeframe sellers dominated the market’s auctions through their attempts to
return price to previously accepted value. But the responsive selling was not
strong enough to completely overpower the higher opening triggered by a
strong other timeframe buyer. Day timeframe structure indicated weakness,
while the market was actually very strong in the longer term.

As illusions go, the preceding example is relatively easy to detect and
evaluate. Unfortunately, the information generated by the market is not
always so clear. In most cases, a more analytical approach is needed to
effectively gauge who is winning the battle for control between the other
timeframe buyer and seller.

To evaluate other timeframe control, we will examine range extension,
tails, activity occurring in the “body” of the Proﬁle, and value area placement
in relationship to the previous day. In addition, each of these factors will be
studied further, based on whether the participants are acting on their own
initiative or are willing to act only in response to an advantageous market
movement. Another timeframe participant who acts on his own initiative is
usually more determined than one who merely responds to a beneﬁcial
opportunity.

This section will deal with evaluating who has control

in the day
timeframe. The ability to process information through the Proﬁle structures
enables a trader to recognize attractive day timeframe trades. Long-term
traders must also be able to read and interpret day timeframe structure, for a
long-term auction is simply a series of day auctions moving through time.
Long-term auction evaluation and value area placement requires far more
analysis and will be detailed in Chapter 4. We mention it here to avoid
creating the illusion that day timeframe control is all conclusive—it merely
reﬂects activity occurring during one day in the life of a longer-term auction.
Learning to read and interpret day timeframe structure is beneﬁcial to all
market participants at one time or another. This understanding most
obviously inﬂuences the individual who trades only in the day timeframe
—in other words, one who begins and ends each day with no position.
However, all long-term traders are also day traders on the day that they
initiate or exit a trade. The concept of longer timeframe participation in the
day timeframe is best expressed through two examples.

Imagine a food company that purchases a large amount of corn for its
cereal processing plant. The food processor has an opinion that corn prices
will rise but also wants to be appropriately hedged against loss. Thus, as the
price of corn rises, the company gradually sells grain futures against its
inventory, in effect scaling in a hedge. On one particular morning, corn
opens far above the previous day’s value, but early Proﬁle structure indicates
weakness. The processor takes advantage of the higher open and expands the
size of its hedge (by selling more futures). However, as price auctions lower
over the course of the day, the processor may partially close out its shorts,
seeking to replace them later at higher prices. The food company’s hedging
goals are clearly long term. However, when the market created an
opportunity in the day timeframe, the food company elected to trade a
portion of the hedge.

In a second example, a futures fund manager with a bullish bias may elect
to trade around his long-term positions by taking advantage of day

timeframe structure. If market structure indicates that the market is likely to
break, he may sell a percentage of his position, reestablishing it later in the
day. In fact, if there is enough volatility in the market, he may reposition a
portion of his inventory more than once on the same day.

Putting aside the longer term for a later section, we will now begin the

discussion of other timeframe control in the day timeframe.

& Other Timeframe Control on the Extremes
Tails (or Extremes)

Tails are created when an aggressive buyer or seller enters the market on an
extreme and quickly moves price. Generally, the longer the tail, the greater
the conviction behind the move (a tail must be at least two TPOs long to be
signiﬁcant). A tail at the upper extreme of a day’s proﬁle, for example,
indicates a strong other timeframe seller entered the market and drove price
to lower levels. In terms of other timeframe control, no tail may also be
signiﬁcant. The absence of aggressive other timeframe activity on an
extreme indicates a lack of buyer or seller conviction.

Range Extension

Range extension is another structural feature that identiﬁes control and helps
gauge buyer/seller strength. Multiple period range extension is generally
the result of successively higher or lower auctions. The stronger the control,
the more frequent and elongated the range extension, resulting in a more
elongated Proﬁle (an elongated Proﬁle is an indication of good trade
facilitation). In a Trend day, for example, the other timeframe’s dominance
is clearly evident through continued range extension and price movement
throughout the day.

& Other Timeframe Control in the Body
of the Proﬁle

The role of the larger institutions and commercial participants in the
marketplace is much greater than merely seeking to take advantage of price
as it moves away from value (evidenced by tails and range extension). Many of
the long-term commercial users of the futures exchange have a certain amount
of business they must conduct every day. For example, General Mills must put

boxes of cereal on millions of breakfast tables every morning. Therefore, they
are constantly in the market as part of their daily business.

This more subtle, involuntary other timeframe activity generally takes
place within the body of the Proﬁle. Nonetheless, it plays an important part
in our evaluation of the competition that goes on between the other
timeframe participants. The TPO count provides a means of measuring
the activity of the other timeframe within the body of the day’s Proﬁle.

TPO

Count the Time Price Opportunity as the smallest unit of market measure-
ment. As mentioned earlier, TPO stands for Time, the market’s regulator,
and Price, the market’s advertiser, together creating the Opportunity to buy
or sell at a given price at a particular time. Monitoring the TPO count helps
evaluate other timeframe control within the developing value area.
Speciﬁcally, the TPO count measures the level of imbalance (when such
an imbalance exists) between the other timeframe participant and the day
timeframe (mostly local) trader.

The key to understanding how an imbalance can occur is to recognize that
the other timeframe buyer does not deal directly with the other timeframe
seller. Recall that the local, or scalper, acts as a middleman between these
two long-term participants. Thus, the other timeframe buyer generally buys
from a local, and the other timeframe seller typically sells to a local.
Imbalance occurs when there are more other timeframe buyers than sellers
or more other timeframe sellers than buyers, leaving the local with an
imbalance. Before we can learn how to measure this imbalance, we must
ﬁrst gain a better understanding of how the locals conduct their business.
The locals position themselves between the ﬂow of outside buy orders
and outside sell orders (orders placed predominantly by off-ﬂoor, other
timeframe participants). For example, suppose that a ﬂoor broker receives
an order to sell 100 contracts at, say, $5.00 per contract. The locals would
buy the contracts from the broker and then turn around and sell them to
another ﬂoor broker who has an order to buy 100 contracts at $5.02. In this
situation, the locals perform their role of facilitating trade and, in return,
receive a small margin of proﬁt.

The trade facilitation process is seldom so ideal, however. Often there are
more other timeframe buyers than sellers—causing the local’s inventory to
become overloaded. For example, if an usually large number of sell orders
enter the pit, the local’s inventory begins to accumulate to a point where he

gets “too long.” In other words, the local has purchased too much from the
other timeframe seller. If the other timeframe buyer does not appear
relatively quickly, the local must bring his inventory back into balance in
some other way. One’s ﬁrst thought would be that the local simply needs to
sell off his excess inventory. However, this is not so easy, for reversing and
selling would only serve to accentuate the selling that is already ﬂowing into
the market. Therefore, his ﬁrst priority is to stop the ﬂow of outside sell
orders by dropping his bid in hopes that the market will stabilize and he can
balance his inventory. If lower prices do not cut off selling, the local may
then be forced to “jump on the bandwagon” and sell (liquidate) his longs at a
lower price.

Viewed from another perspective, suppose you decided to try to make
extra spending money by scalping football tickets. A month before the
chosen game, you purchased 20 tickets from the box ofﬁce at $10 each.
In this case, the box ofﬁce is the other timeframe seller and you are the day
timeframe buyer. Over the ensuing month, your team loses every game
and slips from ﬁrst to ﬁfth place. Not surprisingly, the attendance is dismal
on the day of the game at which you intend to sell your tickets. Few other
timeframe buyers (fans) show up. In order to get rid of your inventory
and recover at least part of your costs, you are forced to sell your tickets
at $8 instead of $12 or $15. In this example, there were more other
timeframe sellers than buyers. Consequently, price had to move lower to
restore balance.

The same concepts apply to the futures marketplace. If we can identify
imbalance before it corrects itself, then perhaps we can capitalize on it, too.
Tails and range extension are more obvious forms of other timeframe
presence, but on a volatile or choppy day, much of the imbalance occurs in
more subtle ways within the value area. The TPO count is an excellent
method for evaluating day-to-day imbalance that occurs within the devel-
oping value area.

The TPO count is found by isolating the point of control (the longest line
closest to the center of the range), summing all the TPOs above it and
comparing that number to the total number of TPOs below it. Single-print
tails are excluded from the count, because their implications are clear and
have already been considered when examining activity on the extremes.
Remember, the point of control is signiﬁcant, because it indicates the price
where the most activity occurred during the day and is, therefore, the fairest
price in the day timeframe (price (cid:1) time ¼ value). Figure 3.1 illustrates the
TPO count.

buyer/seller imbalance in the value area. For example, a ratio of 32/24
breaks down to 32 selling TPOs above the point of control, and 24 buying
TPOs below. Note that a value area is not speciﬁcally calculated. Rather, the
methodology of the TPO count (i.e., single-print rejections are not counted)
implies value.

Proﬁle of January 29, 1988. Proﬁle A displays time periods A–F of the day.

As the trading day proceeds, however, our concern is with discovering
exactly who is more aggressive (who is in control) within the developing
value area. Occasionally, activity reﬂected by range extension and tails will
give us some clues regarding which participant is more aggressive on the
extremes. But the value area battles are more subtle and often much slower
to develop. Monitoring the TPO count through time helps us measure how
the wins and losses are stacking up and gives some indication of who will be
the victor in the battle for control in the body of the Proﬁle.

Examine Proﬁle A again. A to F period registers a 13/21 TPO count,
which favors the other timeframe buyers. Consider what this 13/21 TPO
count logically means: The fact that the TPO count below the point of
control is growing larger indicates that, although price is spending time
below the point of control, price is not going anywhere.

Had other timeframe sellers been aggressive within the value area, there
would have been downside range extension. Range extension would have
lowered the point of control (and the perception of value), therefore
balancing the TPO count and quite probably shifting it in favor of the sellers.
With a TPO count building in the bottom half of the value area (buyers) and
no selling range extension, chances are that it is the ﬂoor traders, or locals,
who are selling to the other timeframe buyers.

Proﬁle B in Figure 3.2 shows the TPO count through H period moving
back into balance at 21/22. This temporary return to balance indicates that
the locals’ inventories became too short—in essence, they had sold too
much—and were forced to cover (buy back) some of their shorts to bring
their inventories back into line. Consequently, price rotated up in G and H
periods, as the locals restored balance to their inventories.

Again, in the ﬁnal Proﬁle, other timeframe sellers were not present as
price continued to rotate toward the day’s upper extreme. The L period
TPO print at 93 21/32 (bonds trade in 32nds of $1,000), and subsequent L
period range extension pulled the point of control higher, conﬁrming a ﬁnal
TPO tally in favor of buyers, 30/47. This end-of-the-day imbalance often
provides momentum into the following day.

& Initiative versus Responsive Activity

Knowing whether the other timeframe participants are acting on their own
initiative, as opposed to responding to opportune prices is also important to
understanding their inﬂuence. Traders can determine if activity is initiative
or responsive by comparing the relationship of the day’s structure to the

previous day’s value area. The previous day’s value area acts as the truest,
most recent indication of a level where price has been accepted over time.
Four types of potential activity may emerge:
1. Initiative buying
2. Initiative selling
3. Responsive buying
4. Responsive selling

Brieﬂy, initiative buying is any buying activity occurring within or above the
previous day’s value area. Conversely, initiative selling is any selling activity
that takes place within or below the previous day’s value area. Initiative
activity indicates strong conviction on the part of the other timeframe.

Responsive activity is the opposite of initiative activity. Buyers respond to
price below value, and sellers respond to price above value. Figures 3.3 and
3.4 illustrate these concepts in detail. Looking ﬁrst at the lower right-hand
side of Figure 3.3, the upward range extension in C period and the E period
buying tail represent responsive buying. Buyers are responding to price
considerably below the area of recent price acceptance. In other words,
buyers have responded to the opportunity to buy cheap. Keep in mind that if
price auctions down and ﬁnds buyers, that alone is not responsive. It is the fact that
price is below value that makes the buying responsive.

A responsive buying tail is also initiative selling range extension. For
example, when the grocer lowered prices in his peanut butter extrava-
ganza, it created initiative selling range extension. Buyers responded to
this price below value, returning price to previous levels in a responsive
buying tail. The initiative range extension and the responsive tail were one and the
same activity.

the E period responsive buying tail was

Referring again to Figure 3.3, notice that the ﬂipside of the C period
responsive buying range extension is a C period initiative selling tail.
Similarly,
actually the
outcome of a harsh rejection of E period initiative selling range extension.
In Figure 3.4 we ﬁnd the same thing: C period initiative buying range
extension meets a responsive seller and eventually becomes a responsive
selling tail. If range extension occurs in the last period of the day, however, it
does not indicate a tail as well. A tail is only valid when conﬁrmed by a
rejection of price in at least one additional time period.

Range extension and tails occurring within the previous day’s value area
are also considered initiative. If people choose to buy or sell within the area of

most recently perceived value, their free choice to agree with recent price
levels is really an initiative decision in itself, for they are not responding to
excess price. Like all the information you are learning, the concept of
initiative and responsive action is not just a random designation that should
be committed to memory, but rather a logical characterization of price’s
relationship to value.

Initiative versus Responsive Activity

The entire day’s value area can be classiﬁed as either initiative or
responsive as well. As noted before, this identiﬁcation is important
because it gives the trader an indication of market conviction and
conﬁdence. In short, initiative buying and responsive selling TPOs occur
above the previous day’s value area, while responsive buying and initiative
selling TPOs occur below the previous day’s value area. Any TPO activity
occurring within the previous day’s value area is considered initiative,
although it does not carry as much conﬁdence as initiative activity that
takes place outside of the value area. Figures 3.5 and 3.6 illustrate
these concepts.

& Trending versus Bracketed Markets

Understanding the dynamics of trending and bracketed markets, and the
transition from one to the other, is one of the most difﬁcult auction market
concepts to grasp. In a very real sense, this could be due to the fact that such
an understanding requires a ﬁrm grasp of overall market behavior, as well as
the synthesis of a large part of all Proﬁle knowledge. For this reason, we lay

the groundwork of trending and bracketed markets here, with a more
detailed discussion to follow in the Competent section.

Let us begin with a few common dictionary deﬁnitions of a trend and a
bracket in order to form a basic mental image of the two. Webster’s New
Collegiate Dictionary deﬁnes a trend: (a) “to extend in a general direction:
follow a general course . . . to show a tendency,” or (b) “the general
movement in the course of time of a statistically detectable change; also: a
statistical curve reﬂecting such a change.” Unfortunately, there is no absolute
way to deﬁne a trend, for it is a function of the market and your trading

3GC03

Page 51

timeframe. A trend, put simply, is a divergence of price away from value.
For our purposes, the price divergence in a trend is characterized by a series
of day auctions (value areas) moving in a clear direction over a long period of
time. An example of such a long-term trend is illustrated between points 1
and 2 in the daily bar chart for Crude Oil in Figure 3.7. Figure 3.8 displays
another trend occurring in the S&P 500 (between points 1 and 2) that ends in
a bracket.

Webster’s deﬁnes bracket: (a) “to place within or as if within brackets,” or
(b) “to establish a margin on either side of.” A bracketed market is a series of
price movements contained “as if within brackets.” The market auctions
back and forth between two price levels that serve as a margin on either end
of the range. Referring to Figure 3.8 again, the S&P market began the
bracketing process at point 2, then auctioned back and forth within the
bracket enclosed by points 2 through 6.

Key Elements—A Brief Discussion

We have deﬁned a trend as a divergence of price away from value. While the
divergence may last for an extended period of time, it will not continue
indeﬁnitely—eventually price and value will reach equilibrium.

A trending market ends when price begins to auction back and forth
between two known reference points, forming a bracket or trading range.
A new trend begins when price leaves the bracketed area and is accepted
over time.

Many knowledgeable professionals estimate that markets trend only 20 to
30 percent of the time. Failure to recognize this fact is one of the main
reasons why a large number of traders don’t make money. Many of the
popular technical systems are trend-following systems that require sustained
price movement to be successful. As many traders are painfully aware,
bracketed markets often move just fast and far enough to trigger these trend-
following systems, then the potential move stalls and the market heads the
other way.

It is evident by now that the trader colloquialism “the trend is your friend”
is a misleading expression. It is true that during a trending market, a trader
can make a substantial proﬁt if positioned with the trend. However, if a
trader constantly employs a trend-following system, his chances of success
during a bracketing market are greatly reduced. Therefore, as the market
evolves from trend to bracket and back to trend again, your trading strategy
should change dramatically. Trends require a less active type of strategy;

they need to be left alone. Because of their strong convictional nature, proﬁt
expectations are relatively high. In a trending market, you put the trade on
and then let the market do the rest of the work. Brackets, however, require
a closer, more hands-on approach. The market moves in erratic spurts with
no real long-term directional conviction. The prices that form the bracket’s
extremes provide signiﬁcant reference points by which to monitor future
change (i.e., the start of a new trend, continuation of the bracketing process,
and so forth). To successfully trade a bracketed market, you need to learn
how to identify the outer reaches of the bracket and then take gains quickly
instead of “letting them ride.” Monitoring how the market behaves around
these points of reference helps you gauge your proﬁt expectations and adjust
your trading strategy.

Knowing if a market is in a trend or a bracket is an integral part of a
holistic market understanding. It is vital to formulating, developing, and
implementing your own trading timeframe and strategy.

Trending Markets The key to capitalizing on a trend lies in the trader’s
ability to determine if the trend is continuing—that is, if the divergence of
price is being accepted or rejected by the market. A good indication of trend
continuation lies in observing value area placement. If a series of value areas
is moving in a clear direction through time, then the new price levels are
being accepted and the trend is ﬁnding acceptance. If value areas begin to
overlap or move in the opposite direction of the trend, then chances are
good that the trend is slowing and beginning to balance.

A trend is started by initiative action from the other timeframe participant,
who perceives price to be away from value in the long term. In an up trend,
for example, price is perceived as below value by the other timeframe buyer
and unfair to the other timeframe seller. As price auctions higher, the trend
draws in market participants from many different timeframes until virtually
everyone is a buyer. At that point, the whole world believes the trend will go
on forever, but there is no one left to buy. The upward trend ends, for there
are simply no more buyers, and the responsive seller enters and auctions price
downward, beginning the bracketing process. The other timeframe buyer
and seller’s view of value has narrowed, producing a relatively wide area of
buyer/seller equilibrium contained within the bracket margins.

Bracketed Markets As mentioned previously, a trend typically ends in a
balanced area, otherwise known as a trading range or bracket. Markets
do not trend up, then turn on a dime and begin a trend down. An

upward-trending market auctions higher, balances, then either continues up
or begins to auction downward. Similarly, a down trend ends in a bracketed
market, then either continues down or begins a trend to the up side.

In a bracket, both the other timeframe buyer and seller become
responsive parties. As price nears the top of the perceived bracket, the
seller responds and auctions price downward through the bracket or
equilibrium range. In turn, the responsive buyer enters and rotates price
back to the upside. This bracketing process indicates that the market is in
balance and waiting for more information. Therefore, when price is
accepted above or below a known bracket extreme, the market could
be accepted above or below a known bracket extreme, the market could be
coming out of balance. Monitoring such a breakout for continuation and
acceptance can alert the observant trader to the beginning of a new trend.
To better illustrate the concept of balance and the dynamics of price
rotation within a bracket, consider an everyday example—the car buyer.
Imagine ﬁve different people who go to Rawley’s car dealership to purchase
a car during the same week. They all have the same ultimate goal in mind:
the purchase of the new Series Magma 8.9 automobile. However, the
similarities end there, for chances are good that each is focusing on different
aspects of the same car. One of the ﬁve wrecked his car on the day before and
needs transportation immediately for business purposes. A wealthy college
student likes the style of the Magma and wants all the extras—sunroof,
stereo, power windows, and racing stripes. A suburban, middle-income
family has been pricing cars for several weeks and has been to the Rawley
dealership several times negotiating price. A woman who commutes to a
nearby city is interested in the Magma because of its excellent gas mileage.
The last of the ﬁve is a salesman who simply decides it is time he purchased a
new car. All ﬁve view the same market from vastly different perspectives,
and each has a certain price range in mind that he or she believes is value.
The car dealer, too, has a perception of value that acts as a bracket in the
negotiating process. His idea of value ranges from the lowest markup that
will still clear a proﬁt to the highest price he can get a buyer to pay. When
dealing with each customer, price moves back and forth within his bracket
until an agreement is reached. The college student would probably pay the
most, for he is not worried about price and wants all the added luxuries. The
family would probably get the best deal, for they are long-term buyers who
have researched and bargained over a period of time. The point is that all ﬁve
market participants will purchase the same car, but they will each pay a
different price. The car dealer fulﬁlls the status of middleman, facilitating

trade at different price levels in his bracket by making the necessary deals to
move the cars off his lot.

A bracketed market acts in a similar fashion. When the market is in a
balancing mode, participants consider different factors in their perception of
value. Price auctions back and forth as they respond to the changing factors
that give rise to differing opinions. Technicians, for example, may monitor
stochastic indicators, while fundamentalists look at economic ﬁgures and
news. Still other traders may evaluate open interest, previous highs and
lows, yield curves, and activity in other commodities. Because of this
segmentation, one group of market participants may rule for a short period
of time, accentuating the bracketing process.

A bracket provides less obvious information than a trend, where price
movement and market sentiment are relatively easy to understand. In a
strong trend, the direction of the trend is clear and all market opinion is
generally geared with the trend. Except for entry and exit, a trader does not
need the Market Proﬁle to determine which way the market is trying to go.
In a bracket, however, there is no clear indication regarding longer-term
market sentiment. Because of the varied and often conﬂicting mixture of
opinions that surface in a bracketed market, a trader must look harder to ﬁnd
directional clues. The diversity of these clues brings about the danger of
overweighting any one piece of information and thus getting an incomplete
(and often incorrect) view of the market. When market-generated infor-
mation is organized using the Market Proﬁle, otherwise segmented market
opinions are brought together in one composite information source. In a
sense, the Market Proﬁle is a ﬁlter for all market opinions. By observing and
understanding the Market Proﬁle, it is possible to differentiate short-term
bracketing activity from a potentially strong, sustained price movement. In
other words, the Market Proﬁle conduit is a powerful tool in evaluating
bracket activity and control.

This concludes the basic concepts of trending and bracketed markets. A
more detailed discussion that builds on these concepts will follow in
Chapter 4.

is as if we have been rubbing away at a large fogged-over window, each
concept revealing a slightly larger view of the whole picture. Learning how
markets operate and how to interpret them through the Market Proﬁle is an
evolving process that involves learning an enormous number of facts and
concepts that are all interrelated. Bringing it all together is a challenge that
combines knowledge, dedication, and experience as more of the window is
exposed. Let us attempt to look at what we have uncovered so far in a way
that will help unify what you have learned in the Novice and Advanced
Beginner chapters.

Successful implementation of the Proﬁle depends on being able to answer
just two basic, sweeping questions that stem from the market’s ultimate
purpose in facilitating trade:

Which way is the market trying to go?

and

Is it doing a good job in its attempt to go that way?

Understanding these two questions together is in essence the equation for
determining trade facilitation. As we continue through the more advanced
portions of the learning process, these two questions will become the
cornerstones for understanding the market through the Market Proﬁle.

Competent

Let us think back for a moment to David, the aspiring pianist. David

reached the third level of learning and became a competent pianist after
many months of study and practicing the basics. He began to see each song as
a whole, a certain expression to be performed with a deﬁnite goal in mind.
He still played by reading the notes but achieved continuity in his playing.
In this chapter, we will complete the study of the basic concepts and
theories behind evaluating market-generated information through the
Market Proﬁle. We will give a thorough discussion of practical applications
to day and longer timeframe trading. By the close of Competent, more of
the big picture will be revealed as the basics merge together to make you a
competent trader.

& Doing the Trade

All reasonings concerning the matter of fact seem to be founded on the
relation of Cause and Effect. . . . I shall venture to afﬁrm that the
knowledge of this relation is not in any instance attained by learning a
priori, but arises entirely from Experience.

—David Hume

Knowledge arises from experience. Just as a musician practices diligently
to become a concert pianist and an athlete spends uncounted hours on the
court to become a great tennis player, a trader must gain experience through
actual trading to become an expert trader.

Any effective performance is a combination of knowledge, skill, and
instinct. With each trade, you put your knowledge, your understanding, and

3GC04

Page 60

your experience on the line to be judged by the market. Clearly, it is necessary
to “do the trade” to learn. Experience provides the conﬁdence to overcome
such barriers as fear, hesitancy, and inﬂexibility.

We introduce the psychological side of trading here for good reason. By
the end of the Advanced Beginner stage you should be incorporating what
you have learned and will continue to learn into your trading technique. We
will continue the discussion of the “you” portion of trading once all the
mechanical aspects of the Market Proﬁle have been covered. Remember:
Trading is the link to experience and knowledge.

& Section I

& Day Timeframe Trading

Mike Singletary of the Chicago Bears was the National Football League’s
Defensive Player of the Year during the 1988 football season. Considered by
many to be the ﬁnest linebacker to play the game, Singletary’s all-pro ability
transcended his physical strength and agility.

As captain of his defensive team, he would attempt to, in effect, read the
offense. As simple as this may sound, it is a complex process that involves
both long- and short-term analysis. Singletary spent hours preparing for each
game, studying play charts, game ﬁlms, and player statistics. When the game
started, he knew exactly which plays the opponent had used in every possible
situation, what formations these plays were run from, and who the key
players were in each play. In other words, Singletary did his long-term
homework and, based on the opponent’s past performances, entered each
game with speciﬁc defensive plans in mind.

After the opening kickoff, however, Mike Singletary did not actively
think about the charts and playbooks—he didn’t have time. It is here that
Singletary’s expertise shined. The game ﬁlms and technical information
were, in a sense, a holistic image in his mind. He would act intuitively,
recognize patterns, and quickly direct the defense. His expectations coming
into the game served as guidelines, but he actively assimilated his play to the
evolving offense.

The opposing team’s offensive coach would change his strategy and
composition of plays with every game in an attempt to throw players such as
Singletary off guard. The ability to recognize such changes in time to stop the
play is what makes an expert linebacker.

An experienced day timeframe trader follows the same sort of evaluation
process Mike Singletary used to. He or she begins each day with a set of
expectations that serve as guidelines, based on the market’s past perform-
ance. The trader studies factors such as long-term market direction, recent
value area placement, and the opening call (all topics to be discussed in this
section). Once the market opens, the trader switches to a more intuitive
mindset, molding expectations to the developing structure, such as the
opening type, the open’s relationship to the previous day’s value, and
the auction rotations. Like Mike Singletary, the experienced trader knows
that the market will seldom develop patterns identical to those that have
happened in the past. The ability to recognize these subtle changes as they
occur in the marketplace is what makes an expert trader.

In this section, we will study important structural reference points in the
order that they occur in the unfolding market, beginning with the open and
ending with the close.

& Day Timeframe Directional Conviction

Recall for a moment the two big questions introduced at the end of Chapter
3. The ﬁrst was “Which way is the market trying to go?” The second was “Is
it doing a good job in its attempt to go that way?” Both of these questions
relate directly to the concept of market conﬁdence and directional convic-
tion. The sole purpose behind interpreting other timeframe activity is to ﬁnd out
which way the market is trying to go.

If you know which other timeframe participant is in control in the day
timeframe (or that neither is in control) and with what level of conﬁdence
they have entered the market, then you can successfully answer the two big
questions and position your trade accordingly. We will now discuss how to
evaluate market conﬁdence and directional conviction, emphasizing their
effect on estimating the day’s range. We will start with the ﬁrst available
measure of market sentiment, the opening call.

Opening Call
During one of our advanced trading seminars, a successful ﬂoor trader asked
an intriguing question: “If the opening exceeds or fails to make its opening
call, can that also be considered recordable initiative or responsive activity,
even though the market never actually traded there?” The answer, as you
will see, is clearly “yes.”

Day timeframe trading strategy begins with the succession of early-
morning calls that indicate where the market will open. Opening calls
can occur at any time—from two hours before, to just a few minutes prior
to the actual opening. Observing the succession of calls as the market nears
its open and the call closest to the opening bell is one of the ﬁrst important
pieces of information available to the day timeframe trader.

In the last few minutes before the day’s actual open, the largest and most
active accounts have direct access to the trading ﬂoor through on-ﬂoor
telephone clerks. The telephone lines to these large accounts are often left
open during this period, providing continuous and almost instant commu-
nication with the trading pit. As early indications of price ranges are relayed
to off-ﬂoor accounts around the world, they often attract the attention of the
longer timeframe traders, leading them to place orders. As these orders are
signaled into the pit, they are seen and communicated to other off-ﬂoor
accounts, which in turn may stimulate additional orders. In a sense, the
auction is actually underway before the market opens. This preopening
auction process, although invisible to most, is often as important to
evaluating market direction as the day’s actual trade, for it is composed
almost exclusively of other timeframe participants.

If the early call is perceived as too high or too low, opening call price
levels and the eventual opening price can change quickly. What the astute
ﬂoor trader at the seminar recognized is that the information available before
the opening is often as valuable as looking at a tail on the Market Proﬁle
graphic. For example, if the ﬁrst call is an expected opening around 87 to 19,
but the actual opening takes place at 87 to 12, there is, in a sense, a seven-
tick, hidden selling tail. That tail will be responsive or initiative depending
on where it is located in relation to the previous day’s value area (just like a
visible tail).

The Open
Experienced day timeframe traders start each trading day with a ﬁrm
knowledge of recent market activity, much like Mike Singletary would study
ﬁlms and playbooks before each game. They have done their homework and
watched the opening call to develop some idea of what to expect during the
day’s trading.

When the market opens, less experienced traders may wait for the initial
balance to develop, thinking that there is little information or little to do
prior to the development of structure. Seasoned traders, however, know

that the ﬁrst half hour of trade establishes one of the day’s extremes in the
large majority of cases. As accurate as this fact may be, it is of little value
unless a trader can identify which extreme will hold throughout the day. The
activity occurring during the formation of the initial balance (many times,
just the ﬁrst few minutes) often enables a trader to identify which extreme
has the greatest holding potential. This knowledge alone can play a large part
in forming a trader’s day timeframe strategy.

The Open as a Gauge of Market Conviction After the opening call, the
ﬁrst few minutes of the open provide an excellent opportunity to observe
and evaluate the market’s underlying directional conviction. With an
understanding of market conviction, it is possible to estimate very early
on where the market is trying to go, which extreme is most likely to hold (if
any), and even what type of day will evolve. In other words, the market’s
open often foreshadows the day’s outcome.

Four distinct types of opening activity provide a good indication of the
level of directional conviction and which extreme is most likely to hold
throughout the day. These labels are not carved in stone, however, and
should be used only as a guideline for learning. Like the day types discussed
in Chapter 2, the importance is not in the labels but in the level of market
directional conviction that is displayed. The four types of opens are:
1. Open-Drive
2. Open-Test-Drive
3. Open-Rejection-Reverse
4. Open-Auction

Open-Drive The strongest and most deﬁnitive type of open is the Open-
Drive. An Open-Drive is generally caused by other timeframe participants
who have made their market decisions before the opening bell. The market
opens and aggressively auctions in one direction. Fueled by strong other
timeframe activity, price never returns to trade back through the opening
range. Figure 4.1 illustrates the Open-Drive.

On April 10, copper opened above the previous day’s value area and
promptly trended upward. The strong, driving activity on the part of the
buyer indicated a high level of market conﬁdence. Figure 4.1 shows an
aggressive 12-tick initiative buying tail in A period that ignited a Double
Distribution Buying Trend day. In the majority of cases, the extreme left
behind after an Open-Drive will hold for the entire day.

The market’s behavior during an Open-Drive open can be compared to a
thoroughbred racehorse just as the bell sounds and the gates swing open.
Both the market and the racehorse explode with conﬁdence running high—
their goals are obvious and their direction clear. If a trader expects to trade
such a market, he must act quickly or be left in the dust.

Open-Drive activity sends clear signals to the trader regarding the type
of day to expect—a Trend or Normal Variation day. It also enables
the trader to enter positions earlier, before conﬁrmation by structure.
Examine Figure 4.1 again. Notice the difference between the trade location
for longs entered during the A period tail or the B period pullback, versus
longs entered with range extension in C period. On this day, both would
probably have resulted in proﬁtable trades; however, A and B period longs
gained much better trade location. Understanding Open-Drive activity helps
traders stay one step ahead of structure.

The extreme established by the Open-Drive remains a reliable reference
point throughout the day. If the market eventually returns to trade through
the open and erase the tail, the trader is alerted to the fact that conditions
have changed and trades should be exited.

Open-Test-Drive An Open-Test-Drive is similar to an Open-Drive, except
that the market lacks the initial conﬁdence necessary to drive immediately
after the opening bell. During this type of open, the market generally opens
and tests beyond a known reference point (previous day’s high or low,
bracket top or bottom, etc.) to make sure there is no new business to be done
in that direction. The market then reverses and auctions swiftly back through
the open. This activity, a failed initial test followed by a drive in the opposite
direction, often establishes one of the day’s extremes. An Open-Test-Drive
provides the second most reliable type of extreme after the Open-Drive.
Figure 4.2 illustrates an Open-Test-Drive occurring in soybeans.

The Open-Test-Drive is a classic example of how the human elements so
often inﬂuence market behavior. In Figure 4.2, soybeans had been balancing
(as is evidenced by the successive days of narrowing, overlapping value),
following a sharp break to the downside on April 3 that established a new
long-term low at 708. When a market is in balance, there is little directional
conviction among the participants. Traders need conﬁdence if they are to
participate in a sustained move in either direction. Thus, in the case of the
soybean market on this day, before other timeframe buyers could begin an
up auction with any degree of conﬁdence, they needed to test below the 708
longer term low to see if lower prices attracted new activity (new other

timeframe sellers, in this case). When the test below actually discouraged
activity, buyers could then probe to the upside with conviction. The
result was an Open-Test-Drive that brought in increased activity as
soybeans auctioned higher. As the saying goes, sometimes markets need
to “break to rally” and “rally to break.” Oftentimes, participants need the
security of knowing what is below the lows or above the highs before they can move
the market with conﬁdence.

Page 67

In hindsight, the soybean market activity on April 10 and the ideal trades
that should have been entered are relatively easy to see and understand. In
reality, however, pulling the trigger and placing a trade was an extremely
difﬁcult task. Let us evaluate the situation confronting soybean traders on
this day. First, the long-term auction was down. Second, the previous ﬁve
days had recorded basically overlapping value areas, indicating balance. And
third, on the 10th, the initial breakout appeared to be to the downside.
When the market opened and swiftly auctioned below the balance area lows,
it was easy to assume that price was going to move substantially lower.
When price stalled around 7041/2, it was difﬁcult to remain objective.
The breakout to the downside was initiative activity, which should have
brought in new activity and displayed immediate continuation—but there
was no follow-through. When the breakout failed and price began to auction
higher, longs should have been placed with the knowledge that the price
probe below the balance area lows had actually shut off activity (longs should
have been entered when price returned to the region of the previous day’s
value area, if not sooner).

This trade was extremely difﬁcult to execute because it ﬂew in the face of the most
recent market activity. Even if a trader possesses a sound enough market
understanding to recognize such an opportunity, the ability to execute still
depends on the power of his or her own self-understanding. The anxiety
created by the thought of placing a trade against strong opposing activity
often inﬂuences a trader’s ability to trade rationally. This is where the power
of experience takes over. As you begin to personally witness and then
experience more and more of these unique opportunities, you will gradually
build the self-conﬁdence required to become a player, instead of a spectator.
The strategy for Open-Test-Drive days is similar to that of the Open-
Drive, with the understanding that the tested extreme has a slightly lower
probability of holding. Again, look for a Normal Variation or Trend day to
develop. The odds favor placing trades in the direction of the driving activity,
as close as possible to the tested extreme. However, during this type of open
(like the Open-Drive), placing the trade early is more important than the
immediate trade location. If you wait to buy a pullback or wait to get perfect
trade location, you will often miss the opportunity altogether.

Once price has driven in one direction, it should not return to the point
where the drive began, because the participants who initially drove price
should still be willing to act in that area. A return through the opening range
often indicates that conditions have changed and the Open-Test-Drive
extreme is no longer a reliable trading reference point.

In the Open-Drive and Open-Test-Drive, the initial extreme is established
by the early entry of an aggressive other timeframe buyer or seller. Extremes
created by such conditions are useful day timeframe reference points and
indicate which way the market is trying to go. Unfortunately, these openings
are not nearly as common as the Open-Rejection-Reverse and the Open-
Auction, which lack clear-cut conviction. These ﬁnal two types of openings
are, however, equally important to day timeframe strategy.

Open-Rejection-Reverse The Open-Rejection-Reverse is characterized by a
market that opens, trades in one direction, and then meets opposite activity
strong enough to reverse price and return it back through the opening range.
The initial extreme is established when buying or selling in one direction dies
out, the auction stalls, and opposite activity begins to auction price in the
other direction. An Open-Rejection-Reverse type of open is less convinced
of its direction when compared to the Open-Drive and Open-Test-Drive.
Because of the lower level of directional conviction, initial extremes
generally hold less than half of the time. This is not to say that opposite
activity strong enough to return price back through the opening is
insigniﬁcant. However, in terms of gauging the strength of an extreme
and assessing the day type that will develop, the early entry of the other
timeframe in the Open-Drive is stronger than the late entry of the Open-
Rejection-Reverse. Figure 4.3 illustrates the Open-Rejection-Reverse.

In this example, the Swiss franc opened below the previous day’s value
area, traded lower, and eventually found responsive buyers below .6630.
Buyers returned the price up and through the opening range in Z period.
Such activity provided the trader with three important pieces of
information:
1. Lower directional conviction indicates that this will be a two-sided
trading day, balancing between the other timeframe buyer and seller.
The probability of a Trend day is low.

2. A Normal or Normal Variation type of day should be expected.
3. Since the Y-period initial extreme has a relatively low chance of holding,
there is a strong possibility that the market will return to retest the
opening range.

The key to trading an Open-Rejection-Reverse type of day is patience. As
is shown by early trade in Figure 4.3, shortly after the Rejection-Reverse the
Swiss franc quickly auctioned higher. This is often the case following Open-
Rejection-Reverse type of activity.

Through C period the market appeared strong and well on its way to a big
move to the upside. Less experienced traders often get so caught up in the
swift price movement that they jump on board, thinking that a prime buying
opportunity might be slipping away. It is important to remember, however,
that Open-Rejection-Reverse activity conveys a much lower level of
conviction. Understanding this lack of conviction, combined with the
patience and discipline to wait for the market to rotate back to you,
will come through experience.

Open-Auction At ﬁrst glance, Open-Auction activity reﬂects a market with
no apparent conviction at all. The market appears to open and randomly
auction above and below the opening range. In reality, the conviction

3GC04

15:16:1

Page 70

reﬂected by an Open-Auction largely depends on where the market opens
relative to the previous day. An Open-Auction open that occurs inside the
previous day’s range conveys a different opinion regarding potential day
timeframe development than an Open-Auction that occurs outside the
range. In general, if a market opens and auctions within the previous day’s
value area and range, then a nonconvictional day will usually develop. If,
however, a market opens outside the previous day’s range and then
auctions around the open, the conditions are markedly different. Here, the
market has opened out-of-balance. In this case, while early Open-Auction
structure may suggest nonconviction, the fact that the market is out of balance
means that there is good potential for a dramatic price move in either direction.
This type of Open-Auction activity often gives rise to Double Distribution
Trend days. We follow with a discussion on both types of Open-Auction
activity.

Open-Auction in Range If a market opens within the region of the
previous day’s range and auctions, market sentiment has probably not
changed. Initial extremes formed by Open-Auction activity are not estab-
lished by aggressive other timeframe activity. Rather, the market auctions in
one direction until activity slows, then auctions in the other direction.
The other timeframe is not present with any large degree of conﬁdence.
Figure 4.4 illustrates Open-Auction in range activity.

An Open-Auction in range generally sets the stage for a Nontrend,
Normal, or Neutral type of day. The low market conviction suggests that
any extreme established early on has a low probability of holding throughout
the day. Referring to the Treasury bond market for June 30th in Figure 4.4,
after opening within June 29th’s value area, price auctioned above and below
the open with ease in B and C periods. Such seemingly random trade
indicated that the bond market was in balance and that its participants held
little directional conviction. Without this knowledge, however, a trader
could have been fooled into selling with the C period selling range extension,
thinking it meant that strong other timeframe sellers were present. The
Open-Auction within range made it clear early on that a big day would
be unlikely.

Open-Auction in range strategy is straightforward. Patiently wait for the
market to establish its extremes and perceived value area, and then look to
trade the value area extremes. If a good trading opportunity does not
develop and a Nontrend type of day occurs, it is often wise to simply stand
aside and wait for new activity.

the opening is beyond the previous day’s range suggests that new other
timeframe activity has caused price to seek a higher or lower level.
Given that the market has opened out of balance, there is a greater chance
that directional conviction will develop than if the market had opened and
auctioned within the range. On March 22 in Figure 4.5, for example,
the Treasury bond market opens and auctions substantially above the
value area and range for the previous day. In comparison to the Open-
Auction in range example in Figure 4.4, the activity up to the ﬁrst three
time periods in Figure 4.5 (up to the point of range extension) appears
very similar.

However, it is evident in the two examples that an Open-Auction outside
of range has the potential to be a big day, while an Open-Auction within
value usually lacks conviction. This is evidenced in the fact that March 22
developed into a Selling Trend day, while June 30 resulted in a narrow
Normal Variation day. This concept is discussed at further length in the next
section of this chapter.

Summary The labels we have given the four types of openings are designed
only to make them easier to learn and remember. In reality, two openings
will seldom look alike, and textbook examples are rare. What is important
about the market’s open is the notion that it is possible to evaluate market
directional conviction very early in the trading session.

FIGURE 4.6 Opening Type Summary. O designates the open.

The analysis of the day’s open should not be used in isolation, but as an
integral part of understanding the big picture that gradually emerges as you
learn and develop experience using the Market Proﬁle. As a refresher,
Figure 4.6 is a summary of the four types of opening activity.

& Opening’s Relationship to Previous
Day—Estimating Daily Range Potential

In the large majority of cases, activity during any given day has direct and
measurable implications on the following day. It is only on the relatively
rare occasion when a market moves extremely out of balance that there is
no correlation between two consecutive days. Understanding these

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:4

Page 75

implications enables a trader to more successfully visualize developing
market activity.

The simple fact of whether a new day opens within or outside of the
previous day’s range helps a trader gauge two key day timeframe elements:
(1) trade risk and opportunity, and (2) estimating, or visualizing, the day’s
potential range development. The salient concept here is market balance.
The relationship of the open to the previous day’s value area and range gives
valuable clues to the market’s state of balance and what kind of risk/
opportunity relationship to expect on a given trading day. In short, the
greatest risk and opportunity arise when a market opens outside of the
previous day’s range. This indicates that the market is out of balance. When
a market opens out of balance, the potential for a dynamic move in either
direction is high. Conversely, a market that opens and is accepted (auctions
for at least one hour) within the previous day’s value area embodies lower
risk, but also less opportunity. The acceptance of price within the previous
day’s value area indicates balance, and therefore reduces the potential for a
dynamic move.

We will discuss three different opening/previous day relationships,
highlighting the potential trade risk, opportunity, and range development
for each. The three relationships are:
1. Open within previous day’s value area.

—Acceptance/Rejection

2. Open outside previous day’s value, but within range.

—Acceptance/Rejection

3. Open outside previous day’s range.

—Acceptance/Rejection

& Open within Value—Acceptance

When a market opens within value and is accepted (overlapping TPOs
signify value, or acceptance), this generally indicates that the market is in
balance and that market sentiment has not changed dramatically from the
previous day. Trade risk and opportunity are both relatively low. The day’s
range usually will be contained within the previous day’s range or overlap
one of the previous day’s extremes slightly to one side. It is a trader’s dream
to know ahead of time what the day’s range will be. When a market opens
and builds value within the previous day’s value area, it is possible—very
early on—to make a rough estimate of the developing day’s range potential.

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:4

Page 76

As mentioned before, the mere fact that a market opens and auctions
within value indicates market sentiment has not changed signiﬁcantly. Thus,
generally, the developing range will rarely exceed the length of the previous
day’s range. If you are conﬁdent that one of the day’s extremes will hold, to
estimate the day’s range potential you simply superimpose the length of the
previous day’s range from that extreme. For example, suppose that after
several time periods on a day that opened within value, a buying tail supports
the lower extreme and appears secure. The tail indicates other timeframe
buyer presence and will probably hold throughout the day, thus forming the
bottom of the day’s Proﬁle. If the previous day’s range was 15 ticks, count
up 15 ticks from the bottom of the tail to ﬁnd an approximate limit for the
day’s high. While this is by no means a foolproof rule, it does provide a
consistent approximation and contributes to the visualization needed to
successfully trade in the day timeframe.

Before we proceed to an actual example, let us ﬁrst present a few

guidelines for estimating range potential:
1. Determine the opening’s relationship to the previous day’s value and

range.

2. If an estimate is possible (acceptance in range), identify the initial
extreme that has the greatest potential to hold. Then superimpose
the length of the previous day’s range to arrive at an estimate.
3. Allow roughly 10 percent in either direction, recognizing that this is just

an estimate, not a prediction.

4. As the day develops, early extremes are erased or conﬁrmed and buyer
or seller directional conviction becomes more evident, adjust the estimate
if necessary.

Figure 4.7 illustrates range estimation for markets that open and auction
within the previous day’s value area. The vertical line denoted by Point A
represents a completed day’s range, with the black bar in the middle
designating the value area. On the following day, the market opens and
auctions inside the previous day’s value area, as is evidenced by the auction
rotations back and forth through the open. (The arrows at Point B represent
auction rotations, not necessarily half-hour time periods. The market may
rotate several times in any given time period.) What is most important is that
the market is indeed establishing acceptance within the previous day’s range
and value area through time. This indicates that conditions have not changed
signiﬁcantly from the previous day, and the market will probably demonstrate
similar range development (not necessarily the same high and low).

FIGURE 4.7 Open within Value—Acceptance. O designates the open.

Point C in Figure 4.7 denotes the initial estimation of the day’s potential
range. If the extreme left behind after the ﬁrst auction down eventually
forms an A period selling tail, it has the potential to be the day’s high. If
this is the case, the range is estimated to be the length indicated by the
dotted line at Point C. The range potential is determined by super-
imposing the length of the previous day’s range downward, starting from
the top of the selling tail. These early estimates, however, should be used
only as a general guideline and must be monitored carefully for change.
For example, as the day progresses in Figure 4.7, if the market auctions back
up above the selling tail, a new range must be calculated. The probe to the
upside in C period (denoted by Point D) creates the need to reestimate the
range, for it extends above the initial high and leaves behind a B period buying
tail on the low. Given the new extreme created by the up auction in C period,
the new estimate would be about the length of the dotted line represented by
Point E.

22 and 23, 1988. O designates the open.
Copyright Board of Trade of the City of Chicago 1984. All Rights Reserved.

Let us now look at a real market example. Figure 4.8 shows S&P
activity on September 23, 1988. The market opened within value, which
suggested that conditions for the S&P had not changed overnight.
However, immediately following the open in B period, price “drove
out” of value to the downside, indicating a potential change in market
sentiment. If early seller conviction had been genuine, the selling auction
should have continued below the previous day’s value area, and ultimately
the previous day’s low. However, other timeframe sellers did not
successfully challenge the low of the 22nd, an important day timeframe
reference point. In fact, in C period, the S&P market rotated back up into
the value area and above the open, thus negating the apparent conﬁdence

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:5

Page 79

that was reﬂected by the early Open-Drive selling activity. The fact that
the market was spending time auctioning within the region of the previous
day’s value area (building multiple TPO prints) indicated that market
sentiment had not changed and that, at best, overlapping value would
develop. Moreover, based on the information generated through C period,
it was unlikely that the day’s trade would bring signiﬁcant movement in
either direction. For, while the seller was unable to sustain the opening
drive, the buyer did not have the conﬁdence of knowing what was below
the 22nd’s lows.

Having already visualized the eventual overlapping value, and given the
development of a B period buying tail, the trading opportunities in day
timeframe longs should be visible. The rejection of the B period selling
probe indicated the probable formation of a day timeframe low at 270.30.
By adding the length of the 22nd’s range (285 points) to the B period lower
extreme, it was possible to estimate that the high on the 23rd would be in
the area of 273.15. In this case, the range estimate proved to be exact (not a
common occurrence). Longs placed during the slowing of price in D, E, and
F periods had good potential to be successful trades.

Rejection (Breakout)

When a market opens within the previous day’s value area and drives
out during the ﬁrst half hour of trade (does not build double TPOs to
signify acceptance within value), the market could be breaking out of
balance. If the early breakout drives price completely beyond the limits
of the previous day’s range, then both risk and opportunity are high and
range estimation is unlimited in the direction of the initiative drive
(Figure 4.9).

A market that opens and is accepted within the previous day’s value area
is like a rubber ball bouncing along a level sidewalk. As long as the surface
remains ﬂat (or the market continues to open in balance) the ball will
rebound off the pavement much like it did during the previous bounce. In
contrast, if the sidewalk is cracked and broken (not “balanced”), it is
impossible to determine how far or in which direction the ball will bounce
(Figure 4.10). Similarly, if the market opens out of balance, it is difﬁcult to
tell which way the market will auction and with what force it will move.
Over the next several pages we brieﬂy discuss the remaining opening/
previous day relationships and the potential range development for each.

The guidelines introduced earlier for estimating range potential apply to
these discussions as well.

& Open outside of Value but within
Range—Acceptance

A market that opens outside of the previous day’s value area but within
range is not as balanced as an open within value, but the market is still
bouncing on ﬂat pavement. It is as if the ball simply bounced over a curb
to land in the street. The ball will bounce about the same net distance,
but the height will be reduced by the distance from the sidewalk to the
street (Figure 4.11). Similarly, a day that opens within range but outside
of value will generally produce a range that is similar to the previous
day, but overlapping to one side. The risk on this type of day is slightly

greater than the previous open relationship, but the opportunity is
greater as well. Openings outside of value but within range indicate a
market slightly out of balance and usually result in value that overlaps to
one side.

The method for range estimation used for Openings within Value applies
equally well here. The resulting range development will usually extend
beyond the previous day’s high or low, for the market opens closer to one of
the previous day’s extremes.

subsequently breaks out beyond the extremes of the previous day’s range,

the direction of the breakout (Figure 4.12).

& Open outside of Range—Acceptance

When a market opens outside of the previous day’s range and is accepted,
conditions have changed and the market is out of balance. At this point, one
of two scenarios is possible: (1) the market will continue to drive in the
direction of the breakout; or (2) the market will begin to auction back and
forth at the new price levels (Figure 4.13 illustrates these two relationships).

Page 85

In both cases, as long as price does not return to the previous day’s range,
the market has accepted the breakout.

The greatest imbalance occurs in the ﬁrst scenario, when a market opens
beyond the previous day’s range and continues in the direction of the
breakout (Figure 4.13). The movement away from value is initiative and the
other timeframe often moves price with great speed and conviction. Range
potential is unlimited in the direction of the breakout, and a Trend day is
usually the result.

This type of open offers the greatest potential to the trader who recognizes
the opportunity early and positions him or herself with the breakout.
However, it also poses the greatest risk to the trader who attempts to trade
against the driving initiative auction.

A market out of balance is like a ball that ricochets off a piece of jagged
concrete—there is no way to estimate how far it will bounce. Potential
range development is unlimited and risk is extremely high for the trader who
is positioned the wrong way. Accompanying increased risk, however, is also
the potential for greater opportunity. An open outside of range offers the
potential for a highly successful and proﬁtable trade if market direction is
detected early.

Rejection
When a market opens beyond the previous day’s range and is rejected back
into the range, the potential for a dynamic price move in the direction
opposite to the opening breakout is set into motion. A typical example
would be a market that opens too far above the previous day’s high, fails to
follow through, and is quickly corrected by responsive sellers who return
price to previously accepted value. The day’s range potential
is still
unlimited, for the market opened out of balance and could move signiﬁcantly
in the opposite direction. Figure 4.14 illustrates the range estimation for a
market whose opening breakout is rejected.

Summary

Simply keeping track of where the market opens in relation to the previous
day’s range and value area is valuable market-generated information. A
market that opens within value is generally in balance and awaiting new
information. A market that opens outside of value is out of balance, and
carries with it greater opportunity and risk. By synthesizing the opening’s

relationship to the previous day with other market-generated elements, such
as the opening type and initiative/responsive activity, it is possible to trade
with a more objective understanding of the big picture.

While writing this segment of the book, a day developed in the market
that exhibited many of the opening/value relationships we have just
covered. April 13, 1989, will serve as a review and summation of the
concepts introduced in this section.

& April 13,1989

Before the market opened on Thursday, April 13, traders knew that the
Retail Sales number would be announced at 7:30. In addition, ﬁve major
ﬁgures were to be released on the following day: Merchandise Trade,
Producer Price Index, Business Inventories, Capacity Utilization, and
Industrial Production. And, as usual, a variety of predictions and
contradicting speculations arose from all sides of the market. The anxiety

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:9

Page 87

among market participants was understandably high. To further compli-
cate matters, Switzerland unexpectedly raised its interest rates soon after
the foreign currency futures opened on the International Monetary Market
(IMM). With all these external elements playing havoc in the market, it
was difﬁcult to remain calm and objective. However, traders with a ﬁrm
understanding of the dynamics of opening/value relationships saw many
good trading opportunities unfold on April 13. The following discussion
focuses on the development of six markets: crude oil, S&P 500, gold,
Japanese yen, soybeans, and Treasury bonds.

Crude Oil

In Figure 4.15, crude oil opened substantially above the previous day’s
high. Any such opening that is clearly above or below the previous day’s
range is known as a gap. A gap is the result of initiative other timeframe
activity and indicates that the market is out of balance. In this example,
however, the other timeframe buyer who caused the gap higher opening
was unable to take control and continue the buying auction. In addition,
the development of a narrow initial balance (Point A in Figure 4.15)
alerted traders to the potential for a Double Distribution Trend day in
either direction.

Given that crude oil was out of balance and carried the potential for a
Double Distribution Trend day, traders should have been ready to enter
trades with range extension on either side of the initial balance. Buying
range extension would signal a potentially big day to the upside. Selling
range extension would indicate that the market had opened too far out of
balance and that responsive sellers had entered to return price to value. The
day’s range potential was unlimited in both directions because of the open
out of balance.

Responsive sellers did, in fact, enter and extend the range down. Traders
placing shorts with the selling range extension were well positioned to take
advantage of a dynamic downside move that ultimately retraced the previous
day’s range and closed on its lows.

S&P 500
In Figure 4.16, the S&P gapped open below the 12th’s range (out of
balance), indicating the potential for a big move to the downside or an
“outside day” if price should return up to trade through the gap and retrace

the previous day’s range. In either case, the potential range development
could be very large. After C and D periods failed to trade back into the
previous day’s range, it became evident that the market was indeed out of
balance. The day’s range expectations became unlimited to the downside,
and optimal trade location could have been gained in the auction rotations of
E, F, and G periods before the market broke swiftly in what resulted in a
Double Distribution Selling Trend day.

The previous four days in the S&P had recorded successively higher
highs. On the 13th, many traders had this fact so ﬁrmly implanted in their
minds that they responded emotionally to the price break, thinking it was a
prime opportunity to buy a strong market below value. Over weighting or
focusing on just one or two facts can lead to tunnel vision and inhibit one’s
ability to see the bigger, developing picture. On the other hand, traders
who understood day timeframe structure could have recognized the
imbalance indicated by the opening out of range and entered the short
side of the market.

Gold

Gold on the 13th provided an excellent example of the value of range
estimation. In Figure 4.17, the market opened and drove out of the previous
day’s value area and range, suggesting a potentially big day on the upside.
However, in Z period gold auctioned back down to build double TPO prints
in the 12th’s value area, thus establishing value and limiting the day’s
expectations. When Z period was unable to extend below the open, thus
conﬁrming the Open-Drive structure and Y period buying tail, it was
possible to estimate the range for the 13th by adding the length of the 12th’s
range to the Y period low. The range potential for the 13th, then, was
roughly 392.60 to 397.20, give or take 10 percent. Using this range, longs
placed in the Z period pull-back could have been successfully exited near the
day’s highs.

The area around 393.00 in the gold market had been a support level in the
past, and many traders were waiting for a breakout. The Open-Drive
activity and quick buying auctions in Z and A periods might have suggested
that a big move to the upside was developing, leading many traders to buy
all the way up the range. However, traders who recognized that the day’s
range potential was limited due to acceptance within the 12th’s value area
could have curbed any high expectations and identiﬁed areas providing
good trade location.

Japanese Yen
The activity in the Japanese yen on the 13th displays the signiﬁcance of
acceptance (or nonacceptance) within the previous day’s range and value
area. In Figure 4.18 the yen opened and auctioned just outside of the range of
the 12th. In Z period, a selling auction into the previous day’s range was
ﬂatly rejected, forming a buying tail. Despite the Z period price probe
down, the base (initial balance) for the 13th remained relatively narrow.
This fact, combined with the open out of value and the rejected attempt to
auction down into the previous day’s range, conﬁrmed that the yen was out
of balance and that buyers were in control. Because value was not established
in the 12th’s range (except for one tick), the expectations for the day were
unlimited to the upside. Longs placed after the Z period rejection or with the
A period range extension resulted in excellent day timeframe trade location.

Soybeans

In soybeans on the 13th, the market opened in balance, immediately alerting
the trader that sentiment had not changed signiﬁcantly from the 12th.
Figure 4.19 shows that in D period, soybeans were unable to auction price
above the previous day’s highs and subsequently returned down to trade
through the open in E period. However, without the conﬁdence provided by
knowing what was beyond the 12th’s highs, sellers could not be expected to
auction price signiﬁcantly lower. By superimposing the length of the 12th’s
range from the top of the D period selling tail, it was possible to estimate
the developing range to be from roughly 7231/2 to 7291/2. Traders acting
without this knowledge might have sold with the initiative range extensions
in G and H periods. Shorts placed at these levels resulted in poor day
timeframe trade location (near the day’s lows), as was indicated early by the
range estimate.

Treasury Bonds
Treasury bonds opened in range and were accepted within the previous day’s
value area in Z period (Figure 4.20). While just two ticks of double TPO
prints within the 12th’s value area might seem insigniﬁcant because of the
narrow range on the 12th, two ticks actually accounted for a third of the
value area. This day developed into a trading day with no real conviction.
Due to the open within value, it was apparent early on that this day would be

similar to the 12th—a day in which it would have been best to stand aside
and wait for directional conviction to develop.

Summary
We have now completed our discussion of the market’s open: from the
opening call to the actual open and its relationship to the previous day. As we
proceed farther into the day, remember to consider each new piece of
learning in relation to the whole. The big picture continues to unfold and
more of the fogged window is becoming clear as you move closer to
becoming a competent trader.

& Day Timeframe Auction Rotations

Based on information we have covered thus far, let us review the process a
trader might go through in developing his or her day timeframe strategy.
The ﬁrst signs of underlying market sentiment are formed during the
succession of opening calls, which alerts the trader to possible directional
conviction before the markets opens. He or she then monitors the conviction
demonstrated by the opening, as well as the opening’s relationship to the
previous day’s value area and range. At this point, which is generally within
the ﬁrst hour of trade, the trader should have a good feel for the conﬁdence
behind the market’s initial activity and the likelihood of its continuation. The
next step in the day’s analysis develops as the market’s auction rotations
reveal other timeframe activity and control.

Think of the marketplace as a game in which the other timeframe buyer
and seller are vying for control. In the simplest sense, when the buyer is in
control, prices tend to rise. When the seller is in control, prices generally
fall, like a vertical tug-of-war. When only one participant (usually either
the other timeframe buyer or seller) is in control, the market is referred to
as a one-timeframe market. A one-timeframe market is characteristic of a
Trend day. Interestingly, a Nontrend day is also a one-timeframe market.
During a Nontrend day, control is also in the hands of just one participant—
the local.

If neither party is in complete control, price ﬂuctuates up and down as
one side pulls and tires, then the other, and so on. When both the other
timeframe and the day timeframe participants are sharing control, the
market is in a two-timeframe mode. Two-timeframe market conditions are
common during Normal, Normal Variation, or Neutral days. During a
two-timeframe market, the trader must exercise greater patience, for
more time is required before other timeframe control becomes evident (if
at all).

Consistent off-ﬂoor trading results are most often achieved by trading
with the control of the other timeframe participant. Obviously, this requires
that one be able to determine who (if anyone) is in control, and second, when
that control may be wavering or reversing altogether. Monitoring the
development of the day’s half-hour auction rotations helps identify which
participant is in control of price at a given moment in time. Before
examining how day timeframe auction rotations help discern other time-
frame control, let us ﬁrst discuss the two basic forms of other timeframe
market control in greater detail.

3GC04

Page 97

Two-Timeframe Markets

In a two-timeframe market, either the other timeframe buyer or seller (or
both) share control with the day timeframe participant. Price rotates up and
down without clear directional conviction, like a balanced tug-of-war.
The resulting activity is similar to the formation of a day timeframe bracket.
The Proﬁle graphic in Figure 4.21 provides a good example of two-
timeframe activity.

During two-timeframe market conditions, examination of the individual
half-hour auctions (each time period viewed separately) does not generally
reveal a dominance by either party. Notice from Figure 4.21 how successive
time periods tend to rotate upon each other and fail to generate sustained
price movement (B overlaps A on the low side, D overlaps C on the high
side, etc.). Neither other timeframe participant is in control.

One-Timeframe Markets

In contrast, occasionally one participant gains the upper hand, causing price
to auction (or trend) in one direction for a sustained period of time. The
market is controlled almost entirely by either the other timeframe buyer or
other timeframe seller. Such unilateral control is referred to as a one-
timeframe market (a day timeframe trending market). A one-timeframe
market is like an uneven tug-of-war in which one side is clearly stronger and
steadily gains ground. The thin, elongated Trend day Proﬁle, shown in
Figure 4.22, is a good example of a one-timeframe market.

Trend days signify a high level of other timeframe conviction and are
characterized by range extension occurring in one direction during several
time periods. Referring to Figure 4.22, notice that the downward rotations
(Z, C, D, F, G, H, and I) are generally stronger than the rotations up (A, B,
and E). One-timeframe seller control is evidenced by the inability of the
buyer to successfully rotate price upward beyond the previous time period’s
auction high during two or more successive time periods. Successively lower
rotations translate into repeated selling range extension.

& Using Auction Rotations to Evaluate Other
Timeframe Control

Determining which other timeframe participant is in control within the half-
hour auctions, once again, falls into the two familiar categories: market

structure and market time. Both play an important role in understanding and
evaluating other timeframe control.

Structure

In the Advanced Beginner chapter, we discussed how to monitor other
timeframe control using structural features such as the TPO count, tails,

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:15

Page 100

range extension, and initiative and responsive activity. In this section we take
a closer look at evaluating other timeframe control through the market’s
half-hour auctions and their offspring—tails and range extension. Our goal is
not to simply identify control, but also to determine when it may be
changing intraday. This concept, called timeframe transition, will be illustrated
following a brief discussion of time.

Half-Hour Auctions

By now, it should be clear that the half-hour auctions provide a vivid picture
of the market’s composure at any point in time. The half-hour auctions are
illustrated in Figure 4.22.

Not only does the relationship of one auction (time period) to another
reﬂect the ongoing status of control, but the auction is often one of the ﬁrst
structural features to signal when control may be shifting. Subtle changes
occurring within the auctions are often the precursor to dramatic changes
that do not appear until much later in the form of tails and range extension.
As we noted earlier, if you wait to enter a trade until after the market
commits itself, you generally will not gain the favorable trade location that is
so important to making objective, rational trading decisions. Tails and range
extension are strong indicators, but if you rely solely on them to judge
timeframe transition, you will often be too late, for they are by-products of the
market’s auctions. Later, in the section entitled “Identifying Timeframe
Transition,” we detail one approach to evaluating subtle changes in the
day timeframe auctions.

Extremes

The extremes, or tails, often provide the most obvious evidence of other
timeframe control. Tails are created when the other timeframe buyer or
seller enters the market aggressively when they feel that price is away from
value. Generally, the longer the tail, the greater the conviction behind the
move.

In terms of other timeframe control, no tail on the extreme is also
signiﬁcant. The absence of aggressive other timeframe activity on an extreme
indicates a lack of buyer or seller conviction. In terms of practical trading
applications, consider a rising market that shows no tail on the day’s low. Such
a scenario suggests that it may be wise to take gains earlier than one might if a
tail were present, for the market is subject to a possible reversal.

Range Extension
Range extension is another structural feature generated by the market’s
auctions that identiﬁes other timeframe control and helps gauge buyer/seller
strength. Multiple-period range extension is the result of successively higher
or lower auctions. The stronger the control, the more elongated the range
extension. If the range is extended in multiple time periods to the upside, for
instance, it is apparent that the market is trying to auction higher and the
other timeframe buyer is exerting a relatively high degree of control. It is
important to monitor this attempted direction for continuation to determine
the success of the market’s attempts to go that way. Like all structural
features, range extension is most useful when taken into consideration with
the rest of the big picture, such as the auction rotations and tails.

Time

The second and perhaps most important ingredient in evaluating timeframe
control is time. As we have noted before, time is the market’s regulator and
is responsible for creating the structures we later identify and interpret.
Simply stated, the less time a market spends trading at a particular price
level, the lower its acceptance of those prices. If the market moves very
quickly through a particular price region, then there is strong other
timeframe presence at those prices that they will generally serve as
support or resistance in the future. For example, a selling tail is the result
of swift rejection by the other timeframe seller at prices perceived to be
above value. The quicker the rejection, the stronger the other timeframe
presence at that price level.

Conversely, the more time spent at a particular price level, the greater
the acceptance of that price. Greater time indicates that two-sided trade is
occurring, and that both the other timeframe buyer and seller are probably
active. It is important to note, however, that time can be a two-edged
sword. If a market is not successful auctioning in one direction over time,
control may reverse as the market seeks to facilitate trade in the opposite
direction. If the market spends too much time at a given level, price will
ultimately be rejected.

The ability to identify the difference between enough time and too much time
is the key to anticipating a change in control. Understanding and interpreting
market activity according to time—instead of relying solely on structure—
improves one’s recognition and execution speed. Time provides the signal,
structure provides the conﬁrmation. An understanding of time allows the trader

Page 102

to enter the market when control ﬁrst begins to change, rather than waiting
until it is conﬁrmed by structure.

Time, however, is an intangible concept and is therefore very difﬁcult to
learn through a derivative source. Not until you personally observe the effect
of time in the marketplace and gain experience through trading will you
come to realize and respect the overwhelming power of time.

Identifying Timeframe Transition

Most trading days do not develop into a pure one-timeframe or two-
timeframe market, just as most tug-of-wars are neither perfectly balanced
nor a total upset. Day timeframe development generally involves a degree of
give and take—one side rallies for a substantial gain, then the opponent
responds with greater effort in order to balance the contest, followed by
another rally, and so on. In a tug-of-war, it is possible to anticipate a change
in control by listening to the participants on either team psyching themselves
up for a new attack.

While varying noise levels on the exchange ﬂoor often signify change, it is
not of much help to the off-ﬂoor trader. However, the Market Proﬁle is a
conduit for listening to the ﬂoor. By observing the developing structure of the
Proﬁle, it is possible to identify timeframe transitions as they occur. The off-
ﬂoor trader might even have an advantage over the ﬂoor traders who are
right there in the action and apparent chaos, for the Proﬁle reﬂects composite
market activity. In a crowded pit, traders may have access to only a portion
of the total activity.

Although each day develops differently, there are a few general categories

of timeframe transition that we can identify:
1. No transition; either one-timeframe or two-timeframe all day.

Example: A Trend day (one timeframe) or most Normal days (two

timeframe).

2. One-timeframe to two-timeframe trade.

Example: A price probe beyond a known reference point (such as a
previous day’s high or a weekly high, etc.) does not attract new activity,
causing the market to return to two-timeframe trade.

3. Two-timeframe to one-timeframe trade.

Example: A market that is in a trading range near a known reference
point that provides resistance or support, then price breaks through and a
trend situation results.

direction.

Example: A Neutral day.

Not only do structure and time help determine who is in control, but they
are also useful in identifying when control may be shifting. To demonstrate
the interplay between time and structure when evaluating timeframe
transition, refer to Figure 4.23 as we walk through the activity occurring
in the Swiss franc on October 12, 1987.

& December Swiss Franc, October 12, 1987

Activity on this day was characterized by early-morning one-timeframe
buying, a midmorning transition to one-timeframe selling, followed by a late

3GC04

Page 104

return to one-timeframe buying. Using a running Proﬁle helps traders
visualize and monitor timeframe transition. A running Proﬁle separates the
day into selected time periods, starting with evidence of a change in control.
The following points of discussion use Figure 4.23 to illustrate the changes in
control that developed in the Swiss franc on October 12.

Y to E: One-Timeframe Buying

One-timeframe buying control prevails during Y through E periods. Notice
the successively higher (or equal) half-hour auction periods. Buyer control
translated into buying range extension in A, B, and D periods. The lack of
signiﬁcant downward rotation shows a conspicuous absence of the other
timeframe seller.

E: Time In E period, price slows. Buyers spent better than a full period
near the high and were unable to extend the range further. Time, in this case
too much time, provides the ﬁrst indication that control may be shifting.

Y to F: Auction Test F period sees the seller enter and rotate price down
below the E period .6710 auction low. This deliberate opposite rotation is
viewed as a test of buyer control. Markets, being controlled by people, often
behave like people. Within any trend, markets need to pause, reﬂect on
where they are, test in the opposite direction, and so on—all in an effort to
determine if they have traveled too far, or have yet to probe farther.
Temporary pauses amid strong price and value trends are a natural, logical
part of the market auction process.

The question to be answered in succeeding time periods is: Does this
initial rotation against the one-timeframe activity reﬂect a loss of buyer
control, or is the buyer merely taking a breather?

G: Transition Conﬁrmation Double prints (two time period TPO prints)
against a one-timeframe auction often conﬁrm that the one-timeframe
activity has ended. Double TPO prints indicate that the market has spent
sufﬁcient time rotating in one direction to justify a potential timeframe
transition.

The FG double prints at .6702—double prints below the .6710 E period
low—suggest that buyers were not just resting, but had relinquished
control. The transition, in this case, is either to two-timeframe trade or
one-timeframe selling. It is too early to tell, structurally, which will result.

Note, however, that even though timeframe control has apparently
shifted, the seller was not aggressive enough to generate a selling tail on the
high. The DE double TPO print on the day’s high represents a high made by
time, not aggressive opposite activity. This indicates a general
lack of
conviction on the part of the seller, and suggests that traders looking for an
opportunity to sell this market should exercise caution.

E to H: One-Timeframe Selling A running Proﬁle starting with E period
(when the one-timeframe upward rotation ﬁrst slowed) indicates one-
timeframe selling extending from E period to midway through H period.

In H period, buyers rotated price above the G period
H: Auction Test
auction high, this time testing the seller’s strength. The strong H period
buying tail reﬂects staunch rejection of lower prices, and stands as an
indication of aggressive other timeframe buying.

I: Transition Conﬁrmation Double HI prints at .6704 conﬁrm yet another
timeframe transition, this time from selling to buying.

H-J: One-Timeframe Buying Following the double HI period prints,
buyers tested and extended the range on the upside once again. Notice
also that buyers had little difﬁculty extending the range beyond the .6716 DE
previous high, an extreme established earlier by a nonconviction seller.

Summary Two-timeframe trades did occur during the periods of transition
(F and H periods); however, the speed of the transition indicates a virtual
immediate transfer of control, rather than a tug-of-war scenario.

& Auction Failures

We have mentioned the term follow-through quite frequently—in our
discussions of trends, breakouts, initiative activity, during the open, and so
on. In fact, follow-through is essentially the answer to the question “How
good of a job is the market doing in its attempts to auction in a certain
direction?” Without follow-through to the upside during a bull trend, the
market, in effect, fails to auction higher. Without follow-through in a golf
swing, the golfer fails to successfully hit the ball. And without follow-
through in a business negotiation, even the most promising deal will likely

fail. The point is that failure to follow through is just as signiﬁcant as
successful follow-through when monitoring market activity.

When a market auctions above or below a known reference point, one of
two scenarios will develop: (1) new initiative activity will fuel continuation
beyond the reference point; or (2) the auction will fail to follow through.
After an auction failure, price is often rejected in the opposite direction with
speed and conviction. The magnitude of this movement depends on the
signiﬁcance of the tested reference point. Known reference points exist in
many forms: daily high/low, weekly high/low, monthly high/low, a break
or rally point caused by an important news announcement, bracket top/
bottom, and so forth. The greater the variety of other timeframe partic-
ipants who are present at the tested reference point, the greater the potential
magnitude of the auction failure. For example, if a selling auction fails to
continue below a bracket low that has held for several months, day, swing,
and other timeframe buyers will be brought into the market en masse, causing
a high level of volatility. The resulting rejection of such a long-term bracket
extreme could trigger a substantial rally and have a signiﬁcant impact on the
direction of the long-term auction.

Let us consider this example in greater detail. When price nears a bracket
bottom, many traders wait to see if the previous support level will hold before
entering the market. If the market should fail to breakout below the bracket
bottom, these traders often respond quickly, causing the market to rally.
Conversely, if price auctions through the bracket low and is accepted, the same
traders may enter the market on the sell side, driving price lower, and adding
fuel to a strong initiative selling auction. Such long-term auction failures are as
important to the day trader as they are to the long-term participant. If a day
trader is aware of long-term support levels and reference points, he or she is
better prepared to capitalize on (or protect him or herself from) the dramatic
day timeframe price movement common during a long-term auction failure. In
fact, the longer the timeframe that the failure represents, the greater the proﬁt
potential (and risk) that is often present in the market.

Figure 4.24 illustrates a long-term auction failure in soybeans. On April
3, 1989, soybeans recorded a new long-term low at 708. The soybean
market then came into balance, as is evidenced by the four consecutive days
of overlapping value that followed. Figure 4.25, on April 10th, shows the
activity that occurred shortly thereafter. Soybeans opened in balance at
7101/2, then quickly drove below the low created on the 3rd (708).
However, the selling auction failed to generate new selling. Two events
generally happen after such a signiﬁcant failure: (1) the participants who

auctioned price lower (generally the short timeframe or local) cover their
shorts and reverse their position; and (2) other traders become aware of the
lack of selling below a known reference point and enter the market with
conﬁdence (the opposite applies to a probe above a signiﬁcant reference
point). On April 10, after the auction below the balance area lows stalled,
buyers responded and drove the soybean market higher. The result was a
Double Distribution Buying Trend day. Traders who monitored the balance-
area lows and the long-term reference point at 708 could have used the
auction failure to secure excellent day timeframe trade location.

Auction failures at shorter timeframe reference points are generally
more subtle and result in smaller price movements when compared to
auction failures at longer timeframe reference points. However, the price
rejection that follows a short-term auction failure can still be swift and
substantial relative to normal day timeframe structure. Figure 4.26 shows a

typical day timeframe auction failure occurring in the Treasury bond
market. On May 16, 1989, bonds auctioned below the previous day’s low
(90.22) in Y period, but failed to follow through to the downside. The
market auctioned lower looking for more selling business, but there were
no sell stops or new activity to sustain the downward price movement.
Armed with the knowledge that there was no new selling below the short-
term lows, bonds traded higher for the remainder of the day and eventually
closed on the highs.

Placing a trade after an auction failure is an incredibly challenging task. In
the previous example, the most recent Treasury bond activity had been
down, and the crowd was selling. When price slowed, indicating potential
failure, it was not easy to enter the market as a responsive buyer. Again, the
best trades often ﬂy in the face of the most recent market activity.

Excess

To achieve its primary goal of trade facilitation, the market auctions lower to
ﬁnd buyers and higher to attract sellers. Ideally, the market ﬁnds a value
range where both the other timeframe buyer and seller perceive price to be
fair so that two-sided trade can take place. However, the market is effective,
not efﬁcient.1 Consequently, in its attempt to generate trade with all
participants, the market occasionally creates excess by auctioning too far in a
given direction.

Suppose that a local baker produces 1,000 loaves of bread daily, which he
sells for 50 cents each. Business is good at this price, and he consistently sells
every loaf he bakes. Because the demand for his homemade bread seems to
have been on the rise, one morning the baker raises his price to 55 cents a
loaf and still sells every one. Pleased with the results, he decides to charge
60 cents the next week, but ﬁnds he sells just 800 loaves—higher prices began
to discourage buying. The baker quickly lowers the price back to 55 cents a
loaf due to decreasing sales volume and shrinking proﬁts. The point is, he
had to raise prices too far above value to be sure that he had found a price that
both he and the consumer perceived to be fair. The baker’s pricing method
created an excess of 5 cents, the difference between the 60-cent extreme and
55-cent value.

Similarly, the market must auction too high to know when prices are
perceived to be above value and too low to know which prices are
considered to be below value. The potential for market excess occurs
any time price trends signiﬁcantly out of balance, or away from value. Excess
is created when the other timeframe recognizes an opportunity and aggressively enters
the market, returning price to the perceived area of value. Evidence of the resulting
excess, in both the day and longer timeframe, can be identiﬁed through
market structure.

Signs of Excess

By deﬁnition, excess is useful only in hindsight analysis, for it is not
identiﬁable until it has already formed. While this is, in fact, true, many
of the structural characteristics reﬂected by the Proﬁle help identify excess
quickly. Tails, for example, are simply day timeframe auction excess. Day
timeframe excess is illustrated in Figure 4.27.

In Figure 4.27, the other timeframe was active on both ends of the range,
entering aggressively and creating day timeframe excess on both extremes.

buyer, establishing a buying tail. Conversely, an E period buying price probe
was rejected by the other timeframe seller, creating a selling tail. Tails are
perhaps the most common manifestation of excess, and they occur in a
similar way in the long-term auction process. Long-term excess is covered
later in “Long-Term Trading.”

Let’s take a moment to look at excess from another, more conceptual,
perspective. Any time a given price level is rejected quickly by the market,
excess is formed. The single prints separating the two areas of a Double
Distribution Trend day are a variety of excess. Just like a tail, they represent
prices perceived as away from value by the other timeframe. A gap is also a
form of market excess, for it is, in effect, an invisible tail.

The importance of any type of excess is that it represents an area that
should serve as support or resistance to price in the future. As long as
conditions have not changed markedly, the other timeframe participant that
drove price so vehemently should react similarly at those same price levels.
This is why a tail can be used to estimate range potential, for it is a reliable
benchmark by which to gauge future activity.

As we near the end of Day Timeframe Auction Rotations, we again address
the question “Which way is the market trying to go?” Thus far, we have
discussed concepts such as directional conviction, initiative and responsive
activity, and other timeframe control—all of which provide bits and pieces
of the answer to the ﬁrst of the two Big Questions. In the day timeframe,
however, we have yet to provide a ﬁnite, objective answer to the question of
market direction. We present here a simple, objective means for evaluating
day timeframe attempted direction based on the market’s half-hour auction
rotations. It is called the Rotation Factor.

At any point in time within the day, segmenting the Proﬁle into half-hour
auctions helps determine which other timeframe participant is currently in
control (or that neither is in control). However, it is not always easy to
inﬂuence. The
determine which participant is exerting greater overall
Rotation Factor objectively evaluates a day’s attempted direction. Each
auction rotation is measured step-by-step, allowing the trader to discern
overall daily directional attempts. Figure 4.28 provides reference for the
following discussion on how to calculate the Rotation Factor.

The method for assigning a value to each time period’s auction rotation is
relatively simple. If the high of the current time period is higher than the

previous period’s high, then the rotation is given a þ1. If the high is lower
than the previous period’s high, then it is assigned a (cid:2)1. Similarly, if a time
period’s low is higher than the previous period’s low, then a value of þ1 is
added. An auction bottom that is lower than the previous period’s low
receives a (cid:2)1. And if both periods’ highs or lows come out even, then no
value, or 0, is assigned. The same process is performed for each subsequent
time period, ultimately resulting in a number that can provide a good
indication of day timeframe sentiment. Figure 4.29, for instance, shows the
Rotation Factor for a day in Treasury bonds. The cumulative rotation
numbers across the time period tops totaled þ3, as did the ﬁgures across the
auction bottoms. The net total for this day is þ6, which exhibits consistent
buyer attempts throughout the day.

It is important to keep in mind, however, that the Rotation Factor only
answers one of the two Big Questions—that is, which way the market is
trying to go. Before any conclusions can be drawn, you must also
determine if the market is doing a good job in its attempts to auction
in that direction. The answer to this second Big Question requires a much
more sweeping analysis than that which can be provided by a simple
measure of the auction rotations. As we proceed through this chapter, we
will thoroughly detail the methods necessary for determining a market’s
directional success.

& Monitoring the POC or Fairest Price

In the ﬁrst edition of Mind over Markets the point of control (POC) was
described as the longest line, reading from left to right, closest to the center
of the range; this is the price that attracted the greatest amount of time.
Price advertises opportunities and time regulates all opportunities; because
this price was accepted over the greatest amount of time it can also be
viewed as the fairest price at which business was being conducted during the
session. Monitoring the fairest price is the best way to visualize what
timeframe is exerting control of the market. On a day in which there is little
inﬂuence from the other or long timeframes the fairest price is less likely to
migrate very far from the center of the range. When the other timeframe
becomes more aggressive we will likely begin to see the fairest price migrate
either higher or lower.

Occasionally, a market will start the day in a two-timeframe mode but
then develop into a one-timeframe market. The Proﬁle structure might
appear to be rotational when, in fact, either the other timeframe buyer or
seller has taken control. This is often a difﬁcult situation to identify quickly.
Thus the trader must learn to recognize the underlying conditions that
often precede such activity, and then monitor those conditions closely. A
change of control often occurs when price auctions near or beyond the
day’s extremes and fails to follow through, causing the auction to reverse
and auction aggressively (one timeframe) in the opposite direction. A
running Proﬁle starting with the time period of potential change (a tail or
breakout) is an effective means for monitoring intraday transition. You
should start a new Proﬁle by splitting the current period away from the
earlier periods.

The purpose in splitting the Proﬁle is so that you can monitor the
migration of the fairest price level. The most important aspect of
monitoring the POC or fairest price level is the ability to visualize the
potential change or no change in the fairest price level. A chess champion
can visualize the huge complexity of potential moves to be made by both
him and his opponent far in advance. Similarly, a successful day trader can
visualize how different market activity will affect the migration of the
fairest price level.

Using Figures 4.30 through 4.34, let us closely examine a day in Treasury
bonds, discussing the visualization process that occurs as the trading session
progresses.

day and divide by 2 to ﬁnd the center of the range. As you begin to watch the
markets you will begin to visualize what effect, if any, range extension will
have; if the market has spent too much time at a single level range extension
it will not change the fairest price level; however, a combination of time and
range extension can change fairest price level.

At the end of D period, the POC moves to 99 00, due to the single tick of

consistent other timeframe buying. Caution: Everything has to be continu-

occurs within the previous day’s range is potentially less important than if it

previous day’s structure.

10:30 a.m. Figure 4.32

The POC moves higher in E period; it may seem improbable that the POC
can move so quickly and cause such dramatic swings in implications;
however, long or short inventory can be acquired or liquidated in a
minimal amount of time, creating control shifts within a single time
period.

After E Period, it is possible to start visualizing potential auction
rotations. If F period trades at the POC (99 03) and auctions lower the
fairest price to conduct business will decline. If F period begins to trade
indicating
higher followed by G and H the fairest price will rise,
that timeframes beyond the day timeframe are continuing to push the
market higher.

Noon Figure 4.33

Auctions in F, G, and H period raise the POC or fairest price at which
business is being conducted; buyers beyond the day timeframe continue to
press the market higher.

Price advertises all market opportunities, while time is the regulator of all
those opportunities. In our current example, while price continues to press
higher, time is restricting the advance. Notice how the POC or fairest price
level to conduct business continues to become more prominent than
the surrounding prices. A healthier market would see a more elongated
Market Proﬁle. The Market Proﬁle gives the market a readable two-
dimensional structure.

place above the fairest price level saw buyers buying price above the fairest
price. When this is occurring traders are taking above-average risk; when we
trade we like to constantly think in terms of odds. Any selling, relative to the

& Day Timeframe Visualization and
Pattern Recognition

Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, once challenged 59 school-
children in separate games of chess—all at once. The competition took place
in a Bronx gymnasium with the chess tables set up in the form of a large
square. The expert strolled from board to board, selecting his moves.
He spent very little time making decisions, while each of his opponents had
all the time they needed. While a child is no match for the skilled
Kasparov, taking on 59 children at once is a challenge to any one individual,
regardless of skill level. Yet, he handily beat 57 of the students, while two
proud young chess players managed to take him to a draw. How did
Kasparov do it, particularly in such a short amount of time? Playing—not
to mention winning—57 matches simultaneously requires something more
than skill alone.

Over the course of his chess career, Kasparov has probably experienced
nearly every conceivable arrangement of the game’s playing pieces. There
are a variety of known and recognizable chess strategies, openings, and so
on. Quite possibly, Kasparov was relying on pattern recognition. He was
speed-reading, or visualizing, the board, recognizing patterns and making
decisions based on past experience in similar situations. Pattern recognition,
or visualization, begins to materialize after extensive practice and experience
in practically any endeavor, whether it be playing chess, predicting the
weather, diagnosing a patient, or trading.

As a trader gains more and more experience observing and trading using
the Market Proﬁle, a number of recognizable patterns begin to surface in day
feature of the Proﬁle
timeframe structure. Virtually every structural
involves pattern recognition in one form or another, and most play a
part in visualizing the developing day timeframe structure. For example, an
Open-Drive outside of the previous day’s range is a pattern that allows a
trader to immediately visualize a Trend day scenario and sustained price
movement throughout the day. Conversely, an Open-Auction in value is
usually a good indication of a more balanced, trading type of day. This
information enables a trader to visualize and estimate the potential extremes
of the day’s range.

Successful trading is assisted by successful visualization. Monitoring the
opening call and open activity allows a trader to visualize the formation of
the day’s auction rotations. In turn, observing the evolving auctions makes it
possible to visualize the type of day pattern that might emerge. Recognizing

certain day types and structural patterns allows the visualization of trade
facilitation and attempted market direction. All these factors contribute to
the ongoing visualization process and make up the big picture for the day
timeframe.

We will discuss here three distinctive patterns that have particularly
interesting implications for day timeframe visualization: short covering
rallies, long liquidation breaks, and ledges.

Short-Covering Rallies

Probably one of the market’s most deceptive and misunderstood behaviors is
known as short covering. Almost all rallies start with “old business” covering
their short positions, which at least temporarily causes price to auction
higher. If this rally is not accompanied by new buying, it is usually due solely
to short covering.

Short covering often follows a day (or several days) of strong selling
activity. As the market moves farther out of balance, participants simply
become “too short.” A sharp rally, generally occurring on or soon after the
open, follows as participants enter to cover (buy back) their short positions.
The need to cover may be a result of: (1) locals simply selling so much that
their inventories become too short; (2) proﬁt-taking after an extended down
move; or (3) other timeframe participants with short positions who are
forced to exit. Like a kettle that whistles when too much steam has built up
inside, a short-covering rally is a short-term event that relieves temporary
market pressure.

After recent strong selling activity, the swift rally that is characteristic of
short covering can be easily misinterpreted as aggressive other timeframe
buying. However, if the rally is truly caused by short covering and not new
buying interest, the market will often resume its prior course once the
selling imbalance has been neutralized. Unfortunately, such quick and erratic
activity can easily heighten market anxiety and cause traders to exit a trade
far too early, or even exit shorts and enter longs. When identiﬁed and
interpreted properly, however, short covering often generates a market-
created opportunity to sell.

As illustrated in Figure 4.35, a short covering rally (that is not
accompanied by new buying) resembles the letter P, or a half-completed
Proﬁle. Once the covering diminishes, price usually recedes and corrects
itself, in effect, ﬁlling in the lower half of the range. The trader’s ﬁrst alert to
potential short covering is the swift, excited rally that is immediately

followed by the virtual disappearance of the buyer. The rally stalls almost as
quickly as it got started. Short covering is caused by old business, not by new
participants entering the market.

This is not to say that every time a market rallies quickly and stalls it is the
result of short covering. There are situations in which the market will rally,
stall, then rally further. For example, the top of a bracket can offer sufﬁcient
resistance to slow price after a strong rally. Once price breaks through the
bracket, however, the rally will generally resume with renewed force.
Figure 4.36 demonstrates this scenario. How, then, can a trader tell the two
apart? Let us refer to Figure 4.37 for illustration.

Short Covering Occurring in the March S&P 500, January 20, 1988

In Figure 4.36, the P formation is evident through E period in the S&P
market. The individual half-hour auctions for B through E periods are
separated to show the short covering rotations, followed by the Proﬁle for
the same period, the B to H Proﬁle, and ﬁnally the completed day. It is
evident that after the initial rally in B period, each subsequent half-hour
auction did a worse job of facilitating trade with the buyer. Nearly every
successive higher auction was lower than the previous auction high. Compare

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:33

Page 127

this formation closely to the formation in Figure 4.36. In Figure 4.36, the
buyer successfully managed to hold his ground, while in Figure 4.37 the
buyer gradually lost ground.

Figure 4.37 projects the waning buyer strength. Through E period, the
half-completed Proﬁle is apparent, looking as if the market needs to rotate
downward and ﬁll in the other half. By F period, the short covering begins to
dissipate, sellers reenter and the day’s structure begins to close in on itself.
In addition, Figure 4.37 illustrates a unique phenomenon not uncommon
during short covering rallies. After the initial rally, the S&P actually
switched to a one-timeframe selling mode beginning with the formation
of the high during C period (each successive auction was equal to or lower
than the previous half-hour auction without extending beyond the high).

Long-Liquidation Breaks

The opposite side of a short-covering rally is the long-liquidation break. The
market forces that cause long liquidation are the opposite of those that
trigger short covering. Due to locals who have gotten too long (bought too
much) or a large number of other timeframe participants exiting their long
positions after an extended up trend, the quick sale drives price swiftly
downward. Again, this selling break is primarily caused by the liquidation of
old long positions, not placing of new shorts. Thus, the liquidating break
generally lasts as long as there are longs to cover (unless the selling break
brings new business into the market and exhibits follow-through). Once
the “sale” is over, the market begins to correct itself. The resulting pattern
often takes the shape of a b (the inverse of the short covering P formation).
Figure 4.38 illustrates a long-liquidation break.

In the S&P market on this day, the market opened and drove sharply
lower through C period. As is characteristic of a long-liquidation break,
subsequent time periods showed a lack of seller continuation and a transition
to one-timeframe buying (in this case, through H period). This particular
example is not nearly as perfect as the short-covering scenario highlighted on
the preceding pages—and few are. Notice that in I period the S&P auctioned
down near the C period lows once again. However, the seller’s inability to
auction below the C period lows reafﬁrmed the lack of seller follow-through
and the continued buyer strength. Once the I period auction failed to attract
new selling, buyers reemerged and completed the Proﬁle.

The liquidation occurring on this day is a vivid illustration of the
importance of visualization and pattern recognition. If you become too

involved in the minute-to minute price movements, it is easy to fall victim to
tunnel vision. The ability to visualize promotes the objectivity that is so
necessary for developing a holistic view of the marketplace.

Summary of Short Covering and Long
Liquidation
A Proﬁle beginning to develop the shape of a P or a b does not imply that
short covering or long liquidation is occurring. Remember, all facts are

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:34

Page 129

surrounded by other circumstances. Properly evaluating short-covering or
long-liquidation patterns requires that the trader make careful note of the
underlying conditions prevailing in the market and the requisite characteristics
that signify each pattern. The main considerations are: (1) the recent market
direction compared to the formation, (2) the open—near the low for a short
covering and near the high for long liquidation, (3) the subsequent non-
continuation after a drive away from the open, and (4) gradually retracing
auctions as the short-term buying or selling releases temporary pressure.

& Ledges

A ledge is a rather strange, awkward-looking formation. In effect, ledges
resemble one half of a normal distribution—as though someone chopped the
Proﬁle in two. Ledges form when a market repeatedly attracts the
responsive participant in its attempt to auction in a given direction.
Consequently, the market stalls again and again at one particular price level.
The half-completed structure of a ledge tends to make a trader feel
uneasy. It seems as though something is bound to happen, that the day’s
Proﬁle is still evolving. Logically and intuitively, the market is almost expected
to spill over the ledge and ﬁll in the day’s Proﬁle. However, if it does not and
the ledge holds, the market may move signiﬁcantly in the opposite direction.
The key to successfully trading a ledge lies in monitoring the activity around
the ledge for clues regarding which scenario will come to pass.

A ledge is often the result of short covering or long liquidation. The
market moves in one direction with short-term conviction, then suddenly
stalls. There is no follow-through to sustain the auction. The market
auctions up, for example, and stalls once the participants who were long
have covered their positions. As time goes on, one of two events can occur:
(1) the lack of continuation to the upside gives sellers conﬁdence to auction
price below the ledge; or (2) the ledge offers support, and buyers enter to
resume the up trend. A typical ledge pattern is shown in Figure 4.39.

The dynamics governing a day timeframe ledge are similar to those
underlying a long-term breakout from a balanced area. Several days of
overlapping value generally indicate that a market is in balance. A breakout
in either direction is a sign that the market is coming out of balance, and
trades should be placed in the direction of the breakout. Similarly, a ledge is
an indication of day timeframe balance, and a breakout from the ledge
indicates a departure from balance. In terms of trading applications, if price

auctions more than a few ticks “off the ledge,” trades should be placed in the
direction of the breakout (unless there are extraneous market conditions
present—news events, etc.). In Figure 4.39, for example, shorts should
have been placed at 4472 when gold dropped off the 4476 ledge in H period.

Summary

The three-day timeframe patterns introduced here are but a small fraction of
the total number of patterns that exist in the marketplace. The different
opening types each form their own identiﬁable pattern. As the market’s half-

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:16:35

Page 131

hour auctions unfold, the patterns characteristic of the different day types
begin to emerge. Almost every aspect of the market’s auction process can be
categorized as some sort of pattern, although not all of them are as speciﬁc as
short covering, long liquidation, and ledge formations.

The importance of pattern recognition is not in the act of labeling
different market structures. Rather, pattern recognition is essential for
understanding current market activity, and more important, learning to
visualize future market development.

& High- and Low-Volume Areas

To conclude our discussion of Day Timeframe Trading, we will examine
high- and low-volume areas and their use in identifying changes in market
sentiment. Market change is accompanied by both risk and opportunity.
The key to securing optimal trade location is the ability to identify market
change as it is developing, before the change is conﬁrmed by structure. By
monitoring signiﬁcant volume-generated reference points, a trader can
anticipate market behavior and maximize trade location in the early stages
of change.

High-Volume Areas

High-volume concentrations develop when the market spends a relatively
large amount of time trading within a narrow range of prices. Both the buyer
and seller are active, forming a short-term balance region in which price
slows to accommodate two-sided trade. In other words, the market
perceives that area to be fair, and volume builds over a period of time.
In the shorter timeframes, high-volume areas represent the market’s
most recent perception of value and, therefore, have a tendency to attract
price. Naturally, all markets eventually undergo change and leave the
high-volume area in search of new value. Should the market subsequently
return to those price levels, the high volume region should once again
attract (slow) price.

We caution that the market’s memory is primarily short term. The
longer price remains away from a speciﬁc region of acceptance, the less
signiﬁcance the high volume will have on the market as it reenters that
region. However, with regard to day and swing traders, an area of
previously established high volume should slow price movement long
enough to provide sufﬁcient time to enter or exit a trade.

For example, suppose the swing auction in Treasury bonds is up, but the
market probes downward into an area of previous high volume. The slowing
of price should provide time to enter a responsive long and then monitor it
for the reemergence of the buyer. Similarly, when seeking to exit an existing
long, a trader can be relatively sure that when a market moves up into a
high-volume area, price will slow enough to allow time to liquidate the long
position.

Identifying High-Volume Levels

Depending on the data vendor, day timeframe traders have three potential
sources for high-volume price information:

1. The Liquidity Data Bank (LDB). Shown in Figure 4.40, the LDB displays
individual price volume information (as discussed earlier). With respect
to isolating areas of high volume, the most signiﬁcant ﬁgure is found in
the %Vol column. These ﬁgures represent the percentage of total
volume occurring at each price traded during the day. In Figure
4.40, the area marked near the center of the range—89 to 05 through
89 to 08—represents the four prices showing the greatest volume during
trade on the 25th. In other words, 9.7 percent of the day’s trade took
place at 89 to 08, while 10.4 percent occurred at 89 to 07, and so forth.
These four prices add up to 40.3 percent of the day’s trade and represent
an area where the following trading session’s auction rotations should
slow, allowing time to position or exit a trade (if an opportunity is
presented at all).

2. The Market Proﬁle Graphic. For those markets without the beneﬁt of
LDB information, the Market Proﬁle graphic provides solid structural
clues regarding the day’s high-volume levels. In the absence of real
volume ﬁgures, the second best measure of high-volume concentrations
are the high TPO prices surrounding the point of control. The thick,
middle portion of the Proﬁle usually closely parallels the LDB high-
volume prices. Price should slow as it enters the “fat” region of the
previous trading session’s Proﬁle.

3. Tick Volume. Tick volume is available through several quote services,
some of which now provide a tick-volume graphic representing the
relative “tick” volume for each price traded as the day’s structure
evolves. Readers should note that tick volume measures the number
of trades that take place; it does not reﬂect the actual contract volume in
each trade. Thus, one tick may equal two contracts or 2,000 contracts—

quite a difference from a trading logic standpoint. Moreover, on low-
volume days (like holidays) tick volume can register quite high
because of heavy local activity, while in reality, actual volume is
low. Still, high tick-volume prices generally coincide closely with the
high TPO prices and, therefore, may be a useful estimate of the high-
volume prices (Figure 4.41). When using tick volume, traders simply
need to be more aware of the underlying liquidity of the market in
which they are trading.

High-Volume Examples

Example 1: Up Auction; Probe down into High-Volume Area

During late October, Treasury bonds were in the midst of a long-term
buying auction. As is demonstrated by Figure 4.42, October 25 recorded
high-volume prices in the 89 to 05 to 89 to 08 region. After a higher opening
on the 26th, responsive sellers attempted to auction price lower during A
and B periods. The selling auctions eventually slowed near the area of the
highest volume concentrations of the previous day. Buyers then entered the
market and returned price above the 25th’s value area.

Given that the long-term direction was up and that the bond market had
opened higher, traders looking for a good location to place a long could
expect price to slow if it auctioned down near the high-volume area of the
25th. If the buying auction was exceptionally strong, however, price would
not have returned to the high-volume area at all. It is important to stress that
traders should not expect the market to stop precisely at the high-volume
levels—remember, high volume attracts price, but it is not a rigid ﬂoor or
ceiling. It is logical for the market to trade around a high-volume area. Thus,
the market could just as easily ﬁnd support or resistance before the high-
volume region as beyond it. The key to taking advantage of high volume is:
(1) do not try to be perfect—ﬁrst execute the trade; and then (2) place your
conﬁdence in the slowing properties of volume. If price had subsequently
been accepted below the high-volume area, traders would have been alerted
that market perceptions of value had changed. Long positions should have
been exited immediately.

While October 26 did not evolve into a big day, it did show general
continuation to the upside through higher value placement. Moreover, when
the Treasury bond market attempted to auction lower in C period, price
slowed and found support at the high-volume levels. Day traders could

observe the downward testing to 89 to 10, place longs against that level, and
rely on the slowing properties of volume should price probe lower.
Example 2: Down Auction; Probe up into High-Volume Area

Figure 4.43 shows Treasury bonds at the start of a potential short-term
down auction. September 14 demonstrates a Normal Variation selling day,
characterized by a strong responsive selling tail and late selling range
extension in K period, resulting in a close in the lower half of the range.
The unusually large selling tail alerted traders to potential buying excess on
the high. Figure 4.43 shows the Proﬁles for September 14 and 15, along with
the %Vol ﬁgures for both. The 14th’s high-volume prices spanned from
roughly 88 to 20 to 88 to 25, accounting for 53.7 percent of the day’s

volume. On September 15, bonds opened and auctioned within the area of
the 14th’s high-volume concentrations. The A, B, and C period rotations
within this high-volume region demonstrated the time offered by high
volume—time to enter or exit a trade. Traders may have chosen to use this
particular opportunity in one of two ways, depending on their level of
conﬁdence in the start of the down auction:
1. No trade until more information was furnished by the market. The
morning’s auction rotations within the previous day’s high-volume areas

3GC04

Page 138

indicated balance. Traders may have elected to enter shorts on a
breakout of this balance, which occurred in H period.

2. Those with more faith in the strength of seller conviction may have used
the time offered early in the morning to enter shorts with good trade
location. When a C period buying probe beyond the initial balance (A
and B periods in Treasury bonds) met with rejection just above the high-
volume area (a form of auction failure), traders recognizing the contin-
ued strength of the seller could have conﬁdently entered short trades (or
exited longs). On the other hand, had price auctioned higher, above 88
to 26 and into the low volume price levels, traders would have been alerted
that conditions had changed. September 15 eventually developed Double
Distribution Selling Trend structure, generating overlapping to lower
values in the direction of the short-term auction.

Low-Volume Areas

it

Low volume typically represents other timeframe directional conviction.
Therefore,
is more likely to see low-volume areas occurring in
unbalanced, trending markets. Low-volume prices are caused by the
same forces that create excess and usually exhibit the same characteristics:
gaps, single TPO prints, and tails (short and long term).

When the rejection demonstrated by a low-volume area develops, short-
term strategy is to place trades using the area of price rejection for support
or resistance. The low-volume area, like excess, should hold against future
auction rotations. For example, single TPO prints separating a Double
Distribution Selling Trend day indicate swift rejection of the initial distri-
bution in search of a new, lower-value area. Shorts placed just below the
single-print, low-volume area should offer good day timeframe trade
location. However, if price auctions back up through the single prints,
then market sentiment has changed and shorts should be exited. When price
auctions through an area of previous low volume, the other timeframe
conviction that initially inﬂuenced price has changed. Traders should heed
the market’s warning and exit any opposing trades.

Imagine a low-volume area as a balloon. The surface of the balloon offers
resistance to the probing of the tip of a pencil. Once the pencil pierces the
balloon, however, there is nothing to stop its motion in the direction of the
initial probe. If a price probe penetrates the extreme of a low-volume region,
then the subsequent price movement is often swift through the remainder of
the low-volume area. However, like the balloon, the low-volume area “gives”

before it breaks. Price must often trade substantially through the low-volume
area before it no longer offers support or resistance.

The means to identify low-volume areas are similar to those previously
covered in the high-volume discussion. The most signiﬁcant measure is again
found in the %Vol column of the LDB, followed by structural indicators, such
as tails and single TPO prints, and tick volume. As an example of using real
volume levels, let us examine the September 15 LDB, shown in Figure 4.44.

Page 140

Two obvious low-volume price areas that came into play on this day span
from 88 to 25 to 88 to 26, and from 88 to 12 to 88 to 16. The low volume at
the upper extreme of the day’s range represents rejection of the 88 to 26
high. The lower volumes in the center of the range suggest that aggressive
other timeframe sellers drove price lower with conviction. These ﬁve prices
add up to only 12.6 percent of the day’s trade and represent a region where
future auction rotations will probably be rejected rather than slowed.
This rejection can assume one of two forms: (1) a dramatic reversal if the
low-volume area holds, visually represented by a tail, or (2) swift
continuation back through the low-volume area, commonly represented
by single TPO prints.

Low-Volume Examples

Example 1: Low Volume as Resistance

At the time of this example, Treasury bonds had formed short-term
buying excess at 89 to 09 on September 14 (circled in Figure 4.45) and were
starting a down auction. September 15 developed a late-forming Double
Distribution Selling Trend day (Figure 4.46), conﬁrming the buying excess.
Figure 4.46 displays the Proﬁles for the 15th and 16th, and their accompa-
nying price/volume ﬁgures. Again, the low-volume area from 88 to 12 to 88
to 16 on the 15th represents swift continuation and other timeframe seller
conviction. This territory should offer resistance during subsequent buying
attempts, at least over the short term.

Two scenarios may confront a trader looking to sell on the 16th. First,
assuming an unchanged to lower opening, good trade location would be
gained just below the 88 to 12 to 88 to 16 low-volume region. Ideally, price
would test higher and be rejected, providing an opportunity to place shorts
near the 16th’s highs. If the market is extremely weak, however, price may
never auction that high. This brings us to the second scenario, again
assuming an unchanged to lower open. If bonds show early selling via
an Open-Drive type of opening, there will be no ideal opportunity for
short placement. In such a high conviction situation, it is best to position
shorts early and then monitor subsequent activity for continuation. Here,
the low-volume area acts as a form of excess, giving credence to the
developing down auction.

As Figure 4.46 illustrates, on September 16 bonds gapped open below the
15th’s lows, indicating potential seller continuation. The lower opening

proved to be too low, however, and responsive buyers entered the market
to take advantage of price perceived to be below value. Subsequent time
periods showed buyers struggling to auction price higher. Eventually, the
buying attempts met with rejection at the 88 to 12 level—the bottom of
the low-volume area separating the two distributions from September 15.

The failure to auction back into the low-volume region offered traders an
excellent opportunity to place short positions.

Ultimately, day timeframe resistance was found just below the low-
volume area and the single print from the previous day’s selling Trend
structure. As with anticipating price slowing near high-volume areas, it is
equally important that traders avoid trying to achieve perfect trade location
near the region of low volume. The keys to taking advantage of low-volume
areas are: (1) keep accurate notes of where they are; (2) know in which

3GC04

15:16:43

Page 143

direction you expect to see rejection and monitor for signs of that rejection;
(3) place orders ahead of time at price levels representing good trade
location to insure execution; and (4) abandon low-volume strategies if price
builds acceptance beyond previous low-volume regions (a price probe
pierces the “balloon”).

Despite the obvious structural buying preference throughout the day’s
activity, September 16 resulted in lower values. This fact, along with the
buyer’s inability to auction price beyond the low-volume area from the 15th,
suggested that other timeframe control remained in the hands of the seller.
Example 2: High and Low Volume Used Together

Activity on the following day, September 19, shows an integration of the
logical workings of both high- and low-volume areas. In Figure 4.47, the
Treasury bond market opened at 88 to 09 and found early rejection just
below the 88 to 11 and 88 to 12 low-volume prices that formed the highs of

September 16. Sellers easily auctioned through the 88 to 03 level, despite its
low-volume percentage (0.8 percent), increasing conﬁdence in short trades.
The fact that price auctioned through 88 to 03 on the 19th conﬁrmed that
this area that had supported the previous afternoon’s buying auctions was no
longer valid.

From a Proﬁle standpoint, note that activity on September 19 generated
an initiative selling tail directly below the low-volume region of the 16th. In
addition, the high-volume levels of the 16th (around 88 to 06 and 88 to 07)
slowed price enough to allow traders time to place shorts with initiative
selling activity.

Summary

The following is a brief listing of the salient concepts involved in under-
standing high- and low-volume areas:
1. Both high- and low-volume regions may be present on the same day if a
transition takes place—if a market evolves from a balanced, two-
timeframe market to one-timeframe trade, or vice versa.

2. Low volume represents rejection, but if the market should return to
auction beyond the low-volume area and build value, then directional
conviction has changed, and the region is no longer a valid reference
point.

3. Both high- and low-volume areas represent support or resistance, but in

vastly different ways.

4. Traders can expect to be able to place or exit trades within high-volume
areas in anticipation of their slowing effect on price. Low volume, on the
other hand, represents swift rejection. Therefore, trades should be
placed or exited in front of that region, for the other timeframe
participant that initially drove price should reject any auction attempts
near the low-volume area.
High- and low-volume areas do not represent “mechanical” trades. They
do, however, provide useful reference points that enable traders to visualize
potential future activity. The importance of such reference points lies in the
detection of market change. By monitoring activity around high- and low-
volume areas, a trader can determine whether or not directional conviction
has changed since the area was formed. Through the detection of funda-
mental change, traders can better manage their risk and identify areas
offering favorable trade location.

Summary—Day Timeframe Trading
Let’s pause for a moment and imagine a vast desert with nothing but sand in
all directions. A man walks along, his throat dry and his lips cracked.
Suddenly, he sees before him a shimmering pool of water just over the next
dune. He runs toward it, relief ﬁnally in sight. He reaches the top of the
sand hill and jumps—only to land in more sand. The water was a mirage
created by the sun and his overwhelming desire to ﬁnd water.

It is important to keep in mind at all times that the market can easily
create a day timeframe mirage regarding long-term market direction. When
a trader is looking too hard for certain market conditions and the market
exhibits some characteristics of what he seeks, the result is often a mirage
that can leave a trader high and dry. For example, when a market opens
substantially above the previous day’s range and attempts to auction down
all day, it appears as if the seller is in control. A trader with a strong bearish
bias might jump into a trade, thinking his or her convictions were correct.
However, if value is still established higher, then the buyer may actually be in
control in the longer term. In this section we discussed day timeframe
control—which way the market is trying to go in the day timeframe. In the
previous example, the seller was in control in the day timeframe. In Section II,
“Long-Term Trading,” we delve into an understanding of the long term that
can prevent a trader from being fooled by day timeframe mirages—an
understanding that will help a trader develop the ability to take advantage of
long-term opportunity.

& Section II

& Long-Term Trading

In Section I, we compared Mike Singletary to a day timeframe futures trader.
He studied charts and game ﬁlms to prepare for each game, but operated
solely in the present tense when he was on the football ﬁeld. Similarly, the
day timeframe trader studies recent market activity, but when the trading
session begins, he or she acts purely on the day’s evolving information. The
academic knowledge becomes synthesized in the trader’s mind to form a
holistic picture, allowing for objective, intuitive decision making.

The long-term trader, on the other hand, is more like Singletary’s coach.
A good coach knows that winning games, or even division titles, does not

insure long-term success. A football team may go undefeated one year but
could easily suffer a losing season the following year if the coach does not
consider the long-term effects of aging players, the upcoming draft, and the
changing abilities of his competitors. The coach builds the strength of his
team over time, bringing in new talent and constantly evaluating the long-
term factors necessary to compile a winning record.

The futures market exhibits similar characteristics. The strength and
duration of a trend is largely subject to the aging of its original participants,
as well as the talent and conviction of any new business that is brought in.
And, like a successful coaching career, successful long-term trading not
only requires winning consistently in the day timeframe, but also a careful
analysis of all the factors that affect the market’s long-term performance.
The discussions in this section are designed to help traders move from
focusing on each individual day timeframe situation to a more holistic,
long-term evaluation. Only through a synthesis of both can one compile a
winning record.

Long-Term Directional Conviction
In “Day Timeframe Trading” (Section I), we studied the progression of the
information generated by the market in the day timeframe. More important,
we examined how a variety of structural and logical relationships produced
by the day timeframe auction process help to convey the directional
conviction of the other timeframe. Because each day auction is a contributing
element to the long-term auction process, these same concepts apply equally
well to long-term market analysis. Not surprisingly, our analysis of the long-
term returns us to the same two all-encompassing questions: “Which way is
the market trying to go?” and “Is it doing a good job in its attempts to go that
way?” We will ﬁrst discuss a series of facts that help us gauge attempted
direction. Later, we examine the methods for evaluating directional
performance. Finally, we unveil an easy, simple Long-Term Activity Record
designed to assist a trader in forming a holistic image of the Big Picture.

& Attempted Direction: Which Way Is the
Market Trying to Go?

on price, a variety of observable, long-term directional changes are

incorporate

Auction Rotations

In Day Timeframe Trading, we detailed a quick method for evaluating the
cumulative directional attempts of a day’s auction rotations. This method,
the Rotation Factor, enables a trader to measure attempted market direction
by producing a value that represents the sum of each day’s half-hour auction
rotations. The theory behind the Rotation Factor is simple. If a greater
number of time periods auction higher than lower, then the buyer is exerting
greater control over price in the day timeframe—the market is trying to
move higher.

The Rotation Factor is by no means an all-conclusive indication of future
market direction. It is, however, a useful tool in determining which way the
market is trying to go in the day timeframe. Since a long-term auction is
composed of a series of day timeframe auctions, recording and comparing
the daily Rotation Factor can help traders gauge the strength and relative
change in a market’s long-term directional conviction.

Range Extension

Range extension signals the entrance of the other timeframe participant
beyond the initial balance. Persistent range extension in several time periods
indicates that trade is being facilitated better in the direction of the range
extension. Observing and recording continual range extension on successive
days reveals a long-term tendency in the market. In Figure 4.48, for
example, ﬁve consecutive days in the Swiss franc saw strong initiative
buying range extension, which alerted traders to the presence of strong
other timeframe buyers fueling the bull trend.

Long-Term Excess
Earlier, we deﬁned short-term excess as the aggressive entry of the other
timeframe participant as price moves away from value, creating a tail in the
day timeframe. An example of short-term excess is evident in gold on
May 2, 1989 (Figure 4.49). The six-tick buying tail in I period was generated
by strong responsive buyers who quickly took advantage of a selling price
probe (range extension) below value. Day timeframe excess not only
provides continual, recordable clues regarding other timeframe directional
conviction, but it also often stands as the pivot point marking a long-term

directional move. The strong buying tail in gold, for instance, supported the
market during subsequent trading sessions.

Long-term excess is caused by the same forces that create day timeframe
excess. When a price level is perceived to be too low in the longer term, for
instance, the other timeframe buyer will enter the market aggressively,
forcing price to quickly auction higher. Prices that are deemed below long-
term value generally form one of three types of excess: an island day, a long-
term tail, or a gap. Refer to the daily bar chart in Figure 4.50 for the
following discussion of the three types of long-term excess.

Long-Term Excess in the Japanese Yen

15:16:49

Page 152

Island Days January 3, 1989 (point A), displays the ﬁrst of the three types
of long-term excess, the island day. Island days are formed by aggressive
initiative activity that causes price to gap above or below the previous day’s
range. The market spends the entire session trading at these higher or lower
levels (attempting to validate price), but returns to previously established
value on the following day, leaving behind an “island” of trade.

On the 3rd, the yen market opened 84 ticks above the high of December
30. After the gap higher open, the yen continued auctioning signiﬁcantly
higher, only to meet responsive sellers that were aggressive enough to
reverse the day timeframe auction and close the yen on its lows. Because of
the weak close on a day that had opened so far out of balance, the possibility
was relatively high that long-term buying excess had formed. Buying excess
was conﬁrmed when the yen gapped some 50 ticks lower on the open of the
following day, creating long-term excess in the form of an island. Island days
are the most extreme form of excess and often provide lasting resistance
against future auction attempts. Figure 4.50 displays another island day
occurring in the yen on April 4 (point G).

Long-Term Tails The second form of excess does not exhibit the violent
gap activity that makes an island day so easy to identify. On a daily bar chart,
this lesser form of price rejection looks more like a day timeframe tail at the
end of a long-term trend. One such long-term tail is evident in the Japanese
yen on January 19 in Figure 4.50 (point B). Compare the enlarged bar chart
in Figure 4.51 to the segmented Proﬁle of the day timeframe tail we
described earlier in gold (Figure 4.52). The half-hour auction rotations are
strikingly similar to the daily auction rotations. This is an excellent example
of how the auction process applies to all timeframes. Day and long-term
excess is created by the same activity occurring over varying lengths of time.
Referring again to Figure 4.50, the yen had been in a downtrend since the
island day on January 3. On the 19th, the yen opened substantially below the
18th’s lows. The gap lower suggested that the downtrend was continuing.
However, the responsive buyer perceived price to be below value and
entered the market aggressively, creating an unusually strong long-term
buying tail. The close on the highs signiﬁed staunch rejection and that
intermediate to long-term excess may have formed.

When using a standard bar chart, every new low or high, it seems, has the
potential to be long-term excess. How does one know which is excess and
which is actually a developing probe to new value? Much like the formation
of a potential day timeframe tail that is not conﬁrmed until the following

half-hour time period, a long-term tail cannot be positively conﬁrmed until
the following day. However, as in the day timeframe, the market does
provide reliable early clues regarding the formation of long-term tails. For
example, examine the activity of January 13 and 18 (points C and D), two
days with similar ranges. Both trading sessions recorded new lows, but they
also closed near their lower extremes, indicating continual seller presence.
In contrast, on the 19th the yen gapped lower on the open, but closed on
the upper extreme. The yen had overextended itself to the downside, at
least temporarily. The responsive other timeframe buyer entered and
quickly auctioned price higher, establishing potential intermediate to long-
term excess.

3GC04

15:16:51

Page 155

Another long-term tail occurred three trading days later on the 24th
(point E in Figure 4.50), as the seller reentered the market after a
substantially higher open and closed the yen on the lows. This price
reversal, occurring so soon after the relatively strong rejection on the
19th, reasserted the strength of the downward trend.

Gaps The ﬁnal type of long-term excess is a gap. A gap is caused by
initiative other timeframe participants who, between the market’s close and
the following day’s open, change their perceptions of value. Price rejection,
in effect, occurs overnight, as the market gaps above or below the previous
day’s extremes on the following day.

On February 9 (point F in Figure 4.50), for example, the yen gapped
above the 8th’s highs, igniting a buying auction away from the balance region
that had formed from January 30 through February 8. During a gap, a
market does not create the typical tail formation that so often signiﬁes
excess. Rather, the gap itself indicates swift price rejection (an “invisible
tail”). In comparison to tails, gaps are actually a stronger, albeit less obvious
form of excess. Note that island days are always conﬁrmed by gaps.

Summary Both short- and long-term excess, when properly identiﬁed,
provide reliable indications of a market’s directional conviction. The price
levels at which the other timeframe participant enters the market and creates
excess are valuable reference points for the long-term trader. Excess is most
often used as support or resistance for long-term trade location. In addition,
if the market returns and trades through the point of excess, a trader knows
that the opposite activity is fueled by a high level of conﬁdence and will most
likely display continuation.

& Buying/Selling Composite Days

A quick way to assess a market’s attempted direction is known as composite
analysis. Composite analysis simply evaluates where the majority of the
day’s trade took place relative to the day’s open; it is performed by dividing
the range into four equal parts. If the open is in the top or bottom one fourth,
it is designated a “composite” day. A composite buying day occurs when the
open resides in the bottom fourth of the day’s range. Conversely, a
composite selling day is characterized by an open within the top fourth
of the range. An open in the center half indicates low directional conviction

in either direction. Point B in Figure 4.50 shows a buying composite day in
the yen. Figure 4.53 illustrates the composite methodology.

The logic behind this theory is relatively simple. If a market spends most
of the day auctioning above the open, then the market is attempting to go
higher. If the market trades below the open for most of the day, then it is
trying to auction lower. Keep in mind that composite analysis does not
consider the question “How good a job is it doing in its attempts to auction in
that direction?” Remember the illusion that can arise from a market that gaps
higher and auctions down all day, but develops higher value. Like all other
directional measures, composite analysis must be evaluated in conjunction
with value area relationships and the level of trade facilitation generated by
the market’s attempt to auction in a given direction.

Summary

Any combination of directional measures may be present on a given day. For
instance, a particular trading session might exhibit composite buying
structure, a positive Rotation Factor, initiative buying tails and range
extension, and higher value—unanimous indications of a market that is
trying to auction higher. On some days, however, the indicators will
contradict themselves. When directional measures conﬂict, they cancel each
other out, indicating a market less conﬁdent in its directional course.

Yet, the answers to the question “Which way is the market trying to go?”
cannot stand alone. They must be considered in conjunction with the second
Big Question, “Is the market doing a good job?”

& Directional Performance: Is the Market
Doing a Good Job in Its Attempts to Get
There?

Let us return to our local grocer for a moment. Suppose that the grocer
decides to expand his business by moving into a bigger building, in hopes of
increasing his market share. In trading terms, his attempted direction is “up.”
Once the move is made, the question then becomes “Will the expansion
facilitate more trade?”

Over the ensuing weeks, the grocer ﬁnds that increased shelf space does
not attract new customers. His business (and expense) has moved up, but
transactional volume has not. Disappointed, the grocer realizes that the
small community cannot support a larger store. Faced with rising overhead
and dwindling proﬁts, he moves back into his old building.

The futures market acts in a similar fashion. Relying solely on which
way a market is trying to go can lead to ﬁnancial disaster, unless you can
also gauge the effectiveness of the market’s attempts to go that way.
Monitoring attempted direction for directional performance—determin-
ing how good of a job it is doing—is the key to a complete market
understanding and long-term trading results. Once attempted direction is
known, three comparative factors are useful in evaluating a market’s
directional performance:
1. Volume
2. Value-area placement
3. Value-area width

Volume

As we get deeper into the long-term forces behind directional conviction, one
element stands high above the rest when it comes to evaluating directional
performance—volume. Not surprisingly, volume is also the best measure of a
market’s ability to facilitate trade. Once attempted direction is known,
volume should be used as the primary means of determining directional
performance.

Put simply, the greater the volume of transactions, the better trade is
being facilitated. In our grocery store example, a larger store did not
generate additional volume and consequently failed. Similarly, in the futures
market, a price movement that fails to generate a fair amount of volume as it
auctions through time will likely not continue for very long in the same
direction.

Evaluating Changes in Volume

To determine whether or not volume is increasing, it is necessary to
compare each day to previous volume ﬁgures. However, there is no standard
number of day timeframe transactions in any market, for volume evolves
with a market’s changing activity. The key to recognizing change is to think
of volume more in terms of market share than in the actual number of
transactions occurring (except, of course, when the number of transactions
drops below that which signiﬁes a liquid market). Therefore, a trader must
keep a running record of volume to be able to detect any signiﬁcant
departures from the current average. This average will vary depending on
your trading timeframe.

Volume as a Measure of Directional
Performance

Suppose that a movie theater raises the price of admission. In the subsequent
weeks, ticket sales drop substantially. At higher ticket prices, the theater is
not facilitating trade for the moviegoer. If the theater is going to stay in
business, it will have to lower price. Decreased volume indicates a rejection
of higher prices.

Volume plays the same role in evaluating the futures market’s directional
performance. For illustration, imagine that the market’s attempted direction
on a given day is up, based on a positive Rotation Factor and buying range

extension. If the buying auctions are generating healthy or increased volume
(relative to your determined norm), then the market is successfully
facilitating trade with the buyer. Conversely, lower volume on a day
attempting to move higher suggests that the market is not accepting the
buying attempts.

Value-Area Placement

A structural indicator that helps us better reﬁne the level of directional
performance is value-area placement. Through an evaluation of the rela-
tionship of one day’s value area to the next, we can move beyond simply
determining if the market is doing a good job, to how good of a job it is doing.
In other words, if attempted direction is up and volume is healthy, what
impact does that have on value? Were buyers successful in placing value
higher? How successful were they? Was value unchanged, overlapping-to-
higher, or completely higher?

Let us brieﬂy describe the different relationships that can exist between
two trading sessions’ value areas. First, value can form clearly higher or
clearly lower, exhibiting obvious directional performance. Second, value
can overlap to one side or the other, indicating a lesser degree of change.
Third, when the value area is contained entirely within the previous day’s
value area, it is known as an inside day. The market is in balance and is not
facilitating trade with either participant. Finally, an outside day occurs when a
day’s value area overlaps the previous day’s value area on both extremes,
and represents greater trade facilitation. Much like a Neutral day, if an
outside day closes in the middle of the range, the market is in balance. If it
closes on an extreme, however, there is a victor in the day timeframe battle
for control. A close on the highs, for example, would indicate directional
performance favoring the buyer. Figure 4.54 illustrates these common
value-area relationships.

Value-area placement often generates signals contrary to day timeframe
attempted direction. Figure 4.55 demonstrates such a scenario occurring in
the Treasury bond market. On September 12, bonds opened unchanged to
higher and spent the entire day auctioning down. The result was a negative
Rotation Factor, selling composite structure, and continued selling range
extension—clearly a market trying to move lower in the day timeframe.
However, higher value was still maintained. While day timeframe structure
indicated seller dominance, value-area placement suggested that the buyer
was still in control in the long timeframe.

FIGURE 4.54 Value-Area Relationships

Evaluating Directional Performance through
Combined Volume and Value-Area Placement

Arriving at a ﬁnal evaluation of directional performance is like baking a
cake—layer by layer. First, we must deﬁne attempted direction. Second, we
evaluate trade facilitation according to volume. And ﬁnally, we must
determine the relative success of that trade facilitation according to its
impact on value-area placement.

In general, if attempted direction is up, volume is above average (or at
least average) and value is higher, then the market is successfully facilitating
trade at higher prices. However, if attempted direction is up and volume is
lower, then higher prices are cutting off activity—the buying auctions are
resulting in poor trade facilitation. If the buying attempts also result in lower
value, then the other timeframe seller is still in control of the market,
despite day timeframe buyer dominance. The market must then move lower
to resume balanced trade, much like the aforementioned movie theater.

the following discussion. Figures 4.57 to 4.61 include an inset bar chart to

show the activity following the day highlighted by each example. In addition,
note that the volume comparisons in these examples are relative to the
previous day, not a predeﬁned average.

Treasury bonds gapped open above the previous day’s range and drove
sharply higher. Attempted direction was clearly up, as witnessed by an
initiative buying tail, initiative buying range extension, a positive Rotation
Factor and buying composite structure. Substantially higher volume and the
resulting higher value conﬁrmed that the directional performance of the
buyer was strong.

The gold market on July 29th was clearly attempting to auction higher.
And, although the buying auctions managed to build higher value, volume
declined, indicating poor directional performance. Underlying market
conditions were weakening. The inset bar chart shows the subsequent return
to seller control.

After a lower opening on April 15th, bonds spent most of the day
attempting to auction higher. Long-term traders relying solely on attempted
direction might have bought, perceiving day timeframe buyer control and an
opportunity to acquire relatively good intermediate-term trade location.
However, the upward auction attempts actually discouraged trade and were

market that is continuing but slowing and coming into balance or a market
that is in the midst of gradual transition. Subsequent trading sessions should
be monitored carefully for signs of directional conviction.

Value-Area Width
One drawback to day trading is that exact volume ﬁgures are usually not
available until after the trading session is over. However, one practical
way to gauge the level of volume as the day develops is through the value-
area width. On days where volume is relatively low, the value area and the
length of the range tend to be narrow. For example, in Treasury bonds on
April 17, 1989 (Figure 4.62), the value area was only two ticks wide.
Volume was at a scarce 120 thousand contracts. In this particular case, the
lack of facilitation was due to the fact that traders had balanced their
positions in anticipation of the Producer Price Index ﬁgure to be released
on the following day. Conversely, value areas tend to widen on days
exhibiting higher volume (Figure 4.63). On April 27, the value area was a

healthy 16 ticks wide. Volume on this day was just short of 600,000
contracts.

The logic used is that the wider the value area, the greater the range of
prices at which trade is being conducted (see Table 4.2). This results in

increased participation, for as price auctions higher and lower, different
timeframes are brought in to the market as they perceive price to be away
from value. The farther price travels, the better the possibility that new
activity will enter the market, thus creating greater trade facilitation (and
higher volume).

We conducted a limited study comparing total volume with average
value-area width for Treasury bonds from December 14, 1988, through
June 22, 1989 (Figure 4.64). As one would expect, the data clearly showed a
marked increase in volume on days with larger value areas. For example, the
average volume on days with a value area 1 to 5 ticks wide was 127,000
contracts. Days with value areas of 11 to 15 ticks, however, averaged
roughly 284,000 contracts, while value areas of 21 to 25 ticks were
regularly around 313,00 contracts.

Summary: Long-Term Activity Record

We have now covered a variety of ways to measure attempted market
direction and directional performance. Keep in mind, however, that
focusing on just one method can lead to tunnel vision and an incomplete
understanding of true market conditions. It is necessary to synthesize all the
elements of direction and performance to arrive at a holistic market
understanding.

Figure 4.65 contains a simpliﬁed long-term activity record (LTAR)
designed to help traders organize the answers to the two Big Questions
addressed in this section. Figure 4.65 is left blank for you to pull out and

& Long-Term Auction Rotations

The auction process is akin to a vertical tug-of-war, with price moving
higher when buyers are in control and lower when sellers are in control. The
auction rotations are, in a sense, the structural footprints of the rotational
struggle between the other timeframe participants. In the day timeframe,
the auctions take the form of either one-timeframe or two-timeframe
market conditions. Long-term auction rotations are composed of the same
form of activity. However, the “footprints” are recorded over a longer
period of time. A bracket, for example, is a long-term two-timeframe
market, while a trend is a long-term one-timeframe market.

Just as a day trader must be aware of timeframe control, it is crucial for a
long-term trader to know whether the market is trending or in a bracket.
The following discussion details the long-term trade applications of brack-
eted and trending markets. Our goal is to arrive at methods to objectively
assess long-term market movement.

Brackets

In review, markets spend approximately 70 percent of the time in a
trading range, or bracket, in which the other timeframe buyer and seller
become responsive parties. When a market is bracketing, the other time-
frame participants have similar views of value, and the prices at which they
are willing to do business grow much closer together. As price nears the
top of the perceived bracket, the seller responds and auctions price
downward. In turn, the responsive buyer enters at the lower bracket
extreme and rotates price back to the upside. As the market attempts to
facilitate trade between the buyer and seller, price movements tend to be
volatile, auctioning back and forth with no real long-term directional
conviction (Figure 4.75).

It is difﬁcult to deﬁne a bracket in absolute terms. As with a trend, seldom
do two traders have the same deﬁnition of a bracket, for all traders operate
with a different timeframe in mind. The daily bar chart for Treasury bonds in
Figure 4.76 can be broken down into myriad individual brackets. For
example, the entire bar chart could be considered a bracket by a long-term
trader, spanning some six months (point 1 in Figure 4.76). The long-term
participant might seek to buy below 87:00 and sell above 91:00.

A short-term swing trader, on the other hand, might break the bond
market down into a smaller bracket, as shown by point 2 in Figure 4.77. This

balanced region encompasses roughly a month. The swing trader would
attempt to place longs around 88 to 00, then exit and go short above 89 to 16.
Figure 4.78 illustrates some of the many possible brackets contained
within the bond market over this particular six-month period. There are
brackets within brackets . . . within brackets, depending on your trading
timeframe. At point 5 in Figure 4.78, a short-term trader might consider six
days of overlapping value to be a bracket. A long-term trader, however,
would consider that region to be a part of the long-term bracket at point 4.
Even if two traders agree on a balance area, they still may differ on the
actual extremes of the bracket. In Figure 4.79, one swing trader might
consider the bracket extremes to be created by recurring value-area tops and
bottoms. Another swing trader might use price extremes (excess) to deﬁne
the bracket, as in Figure 4.80. The point is, bracket deﬁnition is largely a
product of time. There is no perfect bracket, just as there is no perfect trend.
The important concept to remember is that to successfully trade in a bracketed market,
it is necessary to clearly deﬁne the bracket in which you are trading according to your
timeframe.

It is helpful to literally “draw in” the bracket extremes as you perceive
them. This allows you to visualize future auction rotations and ideal trade
location. When you clearly deﬁne a bracket, you are, in effect, testing
your market understanding. Brackets do evolve, however, and it is
important to constantly monitor for fundamental changes. By observing
and continually reevaluating your view of the bigger picture, you will gain
experience and further the learning process that is necessary to becoming
an expert trader.

Bracket Extremes in Treasury Bonds

Trade Location in a Bracketed Market
Once you realize that you are in a bracketed market and have deﬁned the
bracket extremes, several guidelines can help you secure proper trade
location, improve your trading performance, and manage your trade risk.

Bracket Extremes in Treasury Bonds

Rule 1: Monitor Market Direction and Location within the Current
Bracket All trades in a bracketed market should be placed responsively.
We use the term responsive here in a more generic sense than has been
previously discussed. Consider it this way: The distance from the top of the

3GC04

05/16/2013

15:17:44

Page 190

bracket to the bottom, regardless of the bracket’s size, is similar to a day’s
range. Therefore, the value area is contained within the middle of the
bracket. Longs placed below the bracket value area are considered respon-
sive, as are shorts placed above. Any trade positioned in the middle of the
balance area is initiative and offers poor bracket trade location.

At point 1 in Figure 4.81, for example, the responsive seller responds to
price approaching the top of a bracket. Shorts entered at this point result in
minimum upside exposure relative to downside proﬁt potential. If the
market continues up, movement to the upside should be slowed by
resistance at the top of the bracket. This would allow a trader time to
evaluate the trade and, if necessary, exit the short at minimal loss.

At point 2, however, activity is initiative and trade location is poor for
short positions. Immediate upside exposure is equal to downside proﬁt
potential. A long placed here embodies even greater risk, for the current
medium-term auction is down.

The market eventually auctions back to the top of the bracket at point 3.
Longs placed here with the initiative buyer offer little upside potential with
the risk of price returning to bracket lows. Shorts should be entered at the
upper extreme with the expectation that long-term sellers will respond to
price above value. If price auctions above the bracket top, however (point
4), the market may be poised to breakout of the balanced area. If price is
accepted above the bracket, shorts should be exited and longs placed with
the breakout activity. Conversely, if the upper extreme offers resistance and
price is returned within the bracket, shorts offer excellent trade location. In
both cases, trades should be monitored carefully, for movement is often
swift coming off a bracket.

Rule 2: Markets Generally Test the Bracket Extreme More Than Once If
you miss an opportunity to sell a bracket top (or buy a bracket bottom), do
not scramble to enter a trade for fear that you will not get another chance.
Chasing a bracketed market only results in poor trade location. Over a large
sample size, the market will return to test the bracket extreme on the
average of three to ﬁve times before moving to new levels with conﬁdence.

Rule 3: Markets Fluctuate within Bracketed Regions A market generally
will not auction from one extreme of a bracket to the other in a beeline.
Rather, price ﬂuctuates within the balanced area: from top to middle,
middle to top, middle to bottom, and so on. Due to the price ﬂuctuations,
swing trades placed in the middle of a bracket offer poor trade location.

Rule 4: Monitor Activity Near the Bracket Extremes for Acceptance/
Rejection When price auctions near a bracket low, it is easy to let
objectivity slip and begin to anticipate that the market will travel through the
bracket. After all, recent activity has been to the downside—why should it
stop now? However, it is extremely dangerous to place a short at the bracket
low before the market has exhibited acceptance and follow-through below
the bracket. If you are wrong, you have positioned yourself with the worst
possible trade location, in a market that will most likely auction back to the
bracket’s upper extreme.

Remember, in a bracketed market, both the other timeframe buyer and
seller are responsive participants. Responsive activity is generally much slower
and more gradual to develop. A trader usually has time to monitor the
bracket extremes for rejection or follow-through.

& Transition: Bracket to Trend

All brackets eventually evolve into some form of a trend, just as all trends
end in a balancing area, or bracket. It is an ongoing cycle. Because of the vast
difference in trading techniques during a trend and a bracket, it is necessary
to be able to identify when such a transition is occurring. Again, because
every trader operates within a different timeframe, it is impossible to
positively deﬁne a perfect transition rule. Traders with exceptionally long
timeframes might consider a yearlong trend to be part of a larger bracket.
Conversely, a swing trader might consider a week of consecutively higher
value areas to be a trend. Identifying the transition from a bracket to a trend
is a product of your personal timeframe.

In Day Timeframe Trading, we discussed transition in terms of one-
timeframe and two-timeframe conditions. The same concept can be applied
to the long-term auctions. When a market is in a bracket, both the other
timeframe buyer and seller are present and active (over a longer period of
time). There is no clear long-term directional conviction. A transition
occurs when the initiative participants exert more control over price than
the responsive participants.

In the long-term, transition is marked by the formation of excess conﬁr-
med by sustained follow-through in the opposite direction. The beginning of
an up trend, for example, is usually marked by the aggressive entry of the
other timeframe buyer, creating excess in the form of a long-term buying
tail or a buying gap. The responsive buyer overwhelms the seller, and

the market begins to trend upward, turning initiative as it passes through
previously established value. In Figure 4.82, the buyer entered responsively
at point 1 within a balanced area. The subsequent initiative buying gaps at
points 2, 3, and 4 established strong long-term excess and conﬁrmed the
conviction of the initiative other timeframe buyer. This gapping activity
began an upward trend that spanned some four months.

In the intermediate term, a transition might take the form of a balance-
area breakout. In Figure 4.83, for instance, the S&P had developed three
days of overlapping value (February 1 to 3). On February 7, the S&P broke
out of the balance area, indicating a transition to a trending scenario. The
result was a Double Distribution Buying Trend day. Similarly, Treasury
bonds exhibited an intermediate-term transition from bracket to trend on
April 9 (Figure 4.84). After eight days of overlapping value, a multiple-
distribution Trend day signaled the reentry of an initiative other timeframe
seller with strong directional conviction.

Trends

A trend is the result of clear control and directional conviction by either the
other timeframe buyer or seller. The stronger the conviction underpinning
the trend, the greater the excess that usually sparks the trend’s beginning. In
other words, a trend of great magnitude will typically have an elongated
long-term tail and/or a large gap (invisible tail) that creates a ﬁrm base from
which the trend begins (Figure 4.85). It follows that early trend activity will
tend to be more dramatic and pronounced, witnessed by more range
extensions, elongated Proﬁles, and substantial tails.

Trade Location in a Trending Market

There is no such thing as good trade location during the early stages of a
trend. If the market is truly trending, price will continually lead value. The
key to trade location is simply to get on board early and then monitor the
market for continuation. If a trend is strong, your position should soon be
rewarded with follow-through and your trade location should improve. If
not, then the trend is suspect and trades should be exited.

Early entry in a trending market is more difﬁcult than it sounds, for it
means that a trader must buy considerably above recent perceptions of value.
Picking up the phone and saying “buy it” when price is quickly auctioning
above the last several days’ value areas can be a nerve-wracking experience,

even for the trader who is usually calm and objective. When a trend emerges
after a prolonged balance area, a trader must quickly reverse his or her
trading perspective. It is very difﬁcult to change from a responsive mode to
the go-with, trail-blazing mentality of the initiative trader.

Later in the life of a trend, however, trades should be placed responsively,
or when the market temporarily breaks during an up trend (or rallies in a
down trend). Regardless of where you are within a long-term trend, it is
safest to trade with the trend. You will save the cost of this book ten times over
if you simply do not trade against a trend.

Monitoring Trends for Continuation

One useful way to monitor a trend for signs of continuation and/or slowing
by comparing activity on up days against activity occurring on down days.
While in an up trend, for example, determine which way each individual
trading session is attempting to go. Then, compare the volume generated on
down days versus the up days. If a trend is strong, up days should exhibit
greater trade facilitation by generating higher volume than down days.
When volume begins to increase on days against the trend, then the trend is
aging and may soon begin to balance, or enter a bracket.

& Transition: Trend to Bracket

A trend is ofﬁcially over when the responsive participant is able to exert as
much inﬂuence on price as the initiator. An up trend has ended, for instance,
when the responsive other timeframe seller is able to create signiﬁcant
excess at the top of the trend. Once the trend is over, the market will begin
to balance. As a market begins the bracketing process, traders should revert
to a responsive mode, seeking to sell the top of the bracket and buy the
bottom.

Examine Figure 4.85, containing the daily bar chart for crude oil. The
long-term trend that began in late November 1988 began to balance when
the responsive seller was strong enough to induce a gap lower opening on
March 28, 1989. Although the resulting excess did not last for long, it
indicated that the initiative buyer was weakening and a trading range was
developing.

Figure 4.86 provides a second example of a transition from trend to
bracket, although over a much shorter period of time. After two strong
buying days on January 19 and 20, the Japanese yen began to balance.

The inability of the buyer to establish continually higher value indicated the
presence of the responsive seller. The yen had entered a short-term
bracketing period as evidenced by responsive activity on both extremes
of the bracket (see circled areas).

& Detailed Analysis of a Developing Market

To bring the concepts of a bracketed market to life, we will now take a detailed
look at the developing Treasury bond market from late October 1988 to early
May 1989. We have speciﬁcally chosen this time period for its volatility. A
volatile, bracketing market is a complex and emotionally difﬁcult market to
trade. In a trend, trade location is simply a matter of “Am I too late?” and
“Can I buy above or sell below value?” Trading in a bracketed market, how-
ever, is much more challenging. To be successful, traders must mentally
change gears quickly—literally trade from several different states of mind.
Since markets generally spend between 70 and 80 percent of the time bracke-
ting, such a challenge is the norm—not the exception—in futures trading.
In a bracketed market, the other timeframe buyer and seller are much
closer together in their perception of value (see “Bracketed Markets” in
Chapter 3). Both are actively probing to determine the condition of the
marketplace. As an illustration, consider the development of the computer
chip industry. Early on, when microchips were suddenly in great demand
but only produced by a few suppliers, prices trended steadily higher.
However, as new producers entered the marketplace and existing suppliers
increased their output, the computer chip market entered a bracketing
phase. Price began to auction back and forth between the long-term
participants as their perceptions of value started to narrow. Buyers and
sellers, in effect, were testing each other to determine the condition of the
market. Attempts by producers to raise price were sometimes rejected as
buyers found alternative, less expensive sources. Conversely, sometimes,
higher prices were accepted due to a temporary ﬂux of buyers.

Bracket Reference Points
To successfully trade a bracketed market, you must ﬁrst recognize that the
market lacks long-term directional conviction and, consequently, become
more selective in your trading. In other words, it is essential that you develop
both a hands-on strategy and a minds-on approach to evaluating the market’s
auctions. Because of the closeness of timeframes, the market’s probes for
acceptance of value appear to be extremely disorganized, often to the point
of random rotation. We will show that in some cases this is actually true.
However, there are many other times when the footprints of the market’s
auctions provide valuable information regarding short-term conviction,
enabling alert traders to identify change in its early stages.

The key to selective trading lies in the understanding, recognizing, and
recording of a few very basic reference points. Not surprisingly, these
reference points are generated by many of the market forces we have already
discussed—forces such as market balance, Nontrend days, balance break-
outs, and auction failures. Before we delve into our detailed Treasury bond
example, let us ﬁrst recap a few of the forces that shape a bracketed market.
A market that lacks directional conviction spends the majority of its time
in very short-term balance areas. Intermittently, the market will breakout of
the balance region and make a swift directional move to a new price level,
whereupon it again returns to balance. This chain of events happens again
and again, until conditions change signiﬁcantly and sustained other time-
frame conviction surfaces. Until then, it is wise to maintain a relatively short
trading timeframe. Generally, a trade should be held overnight only if there
is substantial structural evidence in its favor.

There is little opportunity in the short-term balance regions, for they
usually lack any semblance of directional conviction. The sharp price spurts
between balance areas, on the other hand, last for a short period of time but
offer a high degree of opportunity for the trader who is alert and prepared to
take advantage of them. Because of the swift nature of a breakout, traders
must not only be able to recognize the auction behavior that leads to a probe
away from balance, but also have the foresight to enter orders ahead of time
to take advantage of the potential breakout.

The key to early identiﬁcation of a breakout lies in the concept of market
balance. In a bracket, the market develops a series of short-term balance
areas (brackets within brackets), or consecutive days of overlapping value. In
most cases, the direction that the market breaksout of these short-term
balance areas proves to be the beginning of at least a short-term auction. The
salient concept is follow-through. Monitoring a breakout for continuation is
the key to identifying other timeframe control.

In the large majority of cases, a breakout will begin with either a gap or an
auction failure. After several days of overlapping value, a gap opening
indicates that the market is out of balance and could be breaking out in the
direction of the gap. A more subtle form of breakout occurs when
the market tests one extreme, fails to follow through, and breaksout in
the opposite direction, forming an outside day—a day that extends beyond
both of the previous session’s extremes. For example, consider a market that
develops overlapping value on six consecutive days. On the seventh day, the
market tests below the balance area lows, fails to follow through, and then
auctions quickly to the upside, forming an outside day. The initial auction

failure is the ﬁrst indication that the market has the potential to breakout of
balance, for it forms excess and establishes a known reference point. The
frequency of this behavior is witnessed by the great number of substantial
day timeframe price movements that are also outside days.

We emphasize, however, that observing market behavior and actually
placing the trade are two entirely different actions. After several days of
overlapping value, for example, it is easy to grow accustomed to the
seemingly random, back-and-forth balancing. When the market ﬁnally tests
below the short-term bracket low and fails to follow through, it is relatively
easy to recognize the potential for an outside day. However, the ensuing
auction back through the balance area appears to be the same activity that has
lulled the trader to sleep during previous days. As one trader put it, “I can
identify the auction failure and I know that there is a good possibility that the
market will move substantially higher, but . . . I just can’t pull the trigger.
The phone gets extremely heavy.”

Trading a bracketed market is by no means easy, even with clearly deﬁned
reference points. As we stated earlier, you must do the trade in order to
build the experience and conﬁdence necessary to take advantage of a sound
market understanding.

As you proceed through our dissection of the Treasury bond market, one
fact should ring loud and clear. Overlapping value regions, auction failures,
breakouts, and the resulting outside days happen over and over again. They
literally form the backbone of a bracketed market. As you become more
familiar with their formations and consistent behavior, what once seemed to
be virtually random, unorganized behavior will begin to take on a new
meaning, to make sense. You will realize that through these apparently
random auctions, the market is actually organizing itself, fulﬁlling its
purpose—facilitating trade. For the trader, these behaviors and resulting
structural features draw the road map that is so critical to selectively taking
advantage of the dynamic short-term price movements that characterize a
bracketed market. The points discussed below are highlighted in Figures 4.87
through 4.90.

Region A (Figure 4.87) After a strong buying auction, the Treasury bond
market recorded potential buying excess at 90 to 12 on November 1st. The
selling gap denoted by point 1 conﬁrmed the excess and set into motion a
sustained move to the downside. Excess, in this case a long-term selling tail
and a selling gap, should act as resistance to future long-term buying
auctions. If price trades back through these areas of rejection, the condition

of the market will have changed (the other timeframe sellers that initially
drove price are no longer present).

At point 2, the Bond market came into short-term balance, as is
evidenced by two days of overlapping value. On the third day, a probe
above the balance failed to attract buying and was swiftly rejected. Armed
with the knowledge that there was no interest in buying, the bond market
then broke below the balance area to start a new selling auction. The result
was a dynamic outside day. When it comes to being selective in your trades,
these are the conditions that you should be looking for. Identify overlapping

3GC04

value/balance regions. Then, monitor the probes beyond these regions for
acceptance or rejection. If they are accepted, the market will probably
continue to auction in that direction, at least for a few days. If they are
rejected, however, stay alert and get ready to reverse your trading state
of mind.

Note that the failed auction created short-term excess on the day’s
high—remember, markets need to auction too high to know that they have
gone high enough. Point 3 shows the same behavior occurring all over
again. After three days of overlapping value, an auction above the previous
two days’ highs failed, resulting in yet another outside selling day.
Following the breakout at point 3, bonds once again settled into balance,
recording ﬁve days of narrowing, overlapping value (point 4). The bond
market gapped sharply below the balance area on the following day, but
failed to continue. Point 5 shows aggressive responsive buyers closed the
market very near its high on this day, signaling the potential formation of
selling excess. To conﬁrm the excess at 89 to 06, buyers should show
continuation out of this region.

Region B (Figure 4.88) The day following the selling gap at point 5 opened
higher, then auctioned down to test the at 89 to 06 low. Aggressive other
timeframe buyers were still present and they again closed the day on its
highs, conﬁrming the selling excess at 89 to 06. This new buying was fueled
by strong directional conviction, as was evidenced by the fact that buyers
were able to auction price completely through the previous day’s selling gap.
After a quick upward swing auction, point 6 shows that bonds opened and
attempted to auction higher, but failed to take out the short-term excess that
had previously been formed at point 3. On this day, bonds had opened above
the previous day’s range—out of balance. When the buying auction failed and
bonds returned down into the previous day’s range, traders were alerted
that the market possessed unlimited downside potential. Anyone still long at
this point should have exited. Versatile traders might even have entered
short positions, monitoring carefully for seller continuation. The result was
a dynamic, outside selling day.

Point 7 demonstrates how important it is to be able to mentally switch
gears. After the swift outside selling day, sellers were unable to muster
continuation. Bonds gapped higher, erased the short-term excess at points 3
and 6, and stopped directly at the excess created at point 2. The fact that the
bond market stopped at this level is no coincidence. Gaps and other forms of
excess are important reference points. By monitoring activity around them

for follow-through or rejection, a trader can evaluate the market’s direc-
tional attempts.

On the next day (point 8), bonds opened higher and began to auction into
the selling gap established at point 1. However, buyers failed to auction
completely through the selling gap and the market closed near its lows.
The resistance provided by the gap created more than a month earlier was
still intact.

After establishing potential buying excess at point 8, the market quickly
came into balance, as is shown by the development of overlapping value on
the following two days. On the third day, a test of the excess at point 8 failed
(bonds closed on the low), which fueled an intermediate bracketing period

3GC04

Page 207

bounded by excess at points 9 and 10. Note that in the bracketing process the
selling gap at point 1 was erased. The only remaining long-term reference
point to the upside was the 90 to 12 long-term high established on
November 1.

Points 11 and 12 show the familiar overlapping value/balance formation,
followed by a failed auction in one direction and the resulting dramatic price
move in the other. Known reference points come into play again at Point 11.
In this case, the outside day was a result of the seller’s failure to attract new
selling business below the previous day’s low, and also the short-term selling
excess generated back at point 9.

Region C (Figure 4.89) The buying auction at point 13 erased the 90 to
12 long-term high, negating any probability of a long-term top to the bond
market. Treasury bonds then entered a period of extreme volatility.
Although price was migrating higher, there was a total lack of directional
conviction. Traders should have day timeframe traded only until clear
signs of conviction appeared. Bonds ﬁnally gapped sharply lower at point
14—the ﬁrst indication of directional conviction in nearly a month. Point
15 shows a similar nonconviction period occurring in February and March.
The areas marked by points 15 and 16 exhibit a clear lack of excess
supporting their lower reaches—another characteristic of a nonconviction
market. Even though the market began a gradual buying auction at point 15,
it was unlikely that buyers would move price substantially until high-
conviction selling excess was recorded.

Think back to the last time you got into a heated argument with a
good friend. Remember how the issues became emotional rather than
rational? Market behavior during times of nonconviction is much the
same. It is not clear which way the market’s “argument” is heading, nor
when the directional issue will be solved. A lot of unintentional hurt
can be dealt when an argument reaches the emotional level. Similarly,
an irrational, nonconviction market can inﬂict severe ﬁnancial pain on
those who are too stubborn to stand aside and wait for clear signs of
conviction.

Point 16 highlights a balance period that was again tipped over by a failed
auction. After six days of overlapping value, bonds opened higher (out of
balance) but failed to follow through. Price returned to value and the market
broke to the downside on the next day.

Point 17 is yet another outstanding example of the importance of known
reference points. After breaking below the nonconviction region designated

by Point 16, the market came into balance just above the long-term lows
created at Point 5. Sellers were unable to generate continuation below the
89 to 06 low, which attracted the responsive buyer. Bonds closed in the
upper half of the range on this day, signaling the potential formation of long-
term selling excess. Note, once again, that the dynamic outside day was
sparked by a failed auction.

Region D (Figure 4.90) Region D provides several additional examples of
why it is so important to be selective in your trading during bracketed
conditions. Points 18, 19, 20, and 21 show dynamic outside days—two

3GC04

buying and two selling—occurring within a 10-day period. If positioned the
wrong way, each could have dealt a serious ﬁnancial blow. However, note
that all four were preceded by the characteristic clues that often signal their
formation: (1) overlapping value/balance, and (2) an auction failure.

Long-Term Auction Failures An auction failure, for any timeframe,
occurs when a market auctions above or below a known reference point
and fails to follow through. Day Timeframe Trading detailed the forces that
contribute to an auction failure and the characteristics of the rejection that
often follows. The principal difference between a day and long-term auction
failure lies in the magnitude of the tested reference point and, therefore, the
magnitude of the subsequent rejection.

In Day Timeframe Trading, we described the implications of an auction
failure—swift rejection and the opportunity to secure good day timeframe
trade location during a day with the potential to generate signiﬁcant price
movement. We also mentioned that longer timeframe auction failures are
usually followed by ensuing activity of greater magnitude. Suppose that a
market auctions below a low that has held for several months but fails to
attract new business. The ensuing reaction caused by the auction failure
will often involve all timeframes and continue in the opposite direction
for days, weeks, or even longer. Traders who are aware of the long-
term reference points that exist in the marketplace are better prepared to
secure good longer timeframe trade location in the event that a failure
should occur.

The daily bar chart in Figure 4.91 illustrates two good examples of
auction failures occurring in the Treasury bond market. The boxed area
designated by point 1 highlights the activity leading up to an intermediate-
term auction failure that occurred on February 21. Figure 4.92 expands the
boxed area to include the daily Proﬁles for February 9 through 22. After
aggressive other timeframe selling activity on February 9 and 10, the bond
market came into balance, as is evidenced by the development of six days of
overlapping value. On the 21st, Treasury bonds opened above the inter-
mediate term bracket and attempted to auction higher but failed to generate
continuation to the upside. Traders were alerted to the potential for an
auction failure, because the test above the balance area failed to attract new,
initiative buying. In addition, a narrow initial balance indicated the possibil-
ity for a Double Distribution Trend day. Shorts entered during the B period
selling-range extension offered good day, swing, and intermediate-term
trade location.

Point 2 in Figure 4.91 identiﬁes an auction failure following a probe
below a long-term reference point. And, as would be expected, the
subsequent activity is of much greater magnitude. On November 25,
1988, Treasury bonds recorded a long-term low at 86 to 09, forming
long-term excess. After rallying to as high as 91 to 21 in late January, bonds
eventually traded back down and approached the 86 to 09 excess on March
21, 1989—some four months later. On the 21st, price auctioned down and
stopped precisely at 86 to 09. The selling probe failed to stimulate new
activity, and the same responsive buyers were there quickly to buy below
long-term value. In this particular case, the long-term auction failure
sparked the beginning of a major long-term buying trend.

To experienced traders, known reference points serve as checkpoints on
the market map. By observing market behavior at key locations, it is possible
to determine the market’s directional conviction before opportunity has
slipped away.

& Long-Term Short Covering
and Long Liquidation

We discussed day timeframe short covering and long liquidation in Section I.
The same forces that cause short covering and its converse, long liquidation,
are also present in the longer timeframe. After a sustained down trend, for
example, the anxiety level of participants who have been short for an
extended period of time often begins to increase as their proﬁts grow.
Should something trigger covering, the ensuing rally could last for several
days as traders scramble to buy back their short positions. Such swift buying
can easily be interpreted to mark the end of the trend or even the beginning
of a new trend in the opposite direction. However, if the buying is not
accompanied by continuation and elongated Proﬁle structure, the cause is
probably short covering. Short covering is a result of old business covering
positions placed with the original trend, not by new initiative buyers.
The resulting Proﬁles tend to be short and narrow, often developing into
the familiar P formation, indicating a lack of facilitation with the other
timeframe buyer.

Figure 4.93 illustrates the beginning of long-term short covering in
soybeans that was sparked by a selling auction failure on January 26, 1989.
Following a 70-cent ($3,500 per contract) downtrend, sellers auctioned
price near the long-term 740 lows (Figure 4.94) and were confronted by the

Long-Term Short Covering in Soybeans, January 25 to February 7

responsive buying that commonly occurs at long-term reference points. This
knee-jerk type of buying, combined with the seller’s inability to extend price
below 740, triggered a wave of aggressive buying that eventually developed
into a Double Distribution Buying Trend day.

The rally on January 26 put sellers of all timeframes in a tenuous position.
Imagine having the long-term foresight and discipline to build up a 60- or 70-
cent gain in a trade, only to watch the market reclaim 20 cents in just a few
hours. Or even worse, suppose that you sold into the trend late and had
gains of only a nickel, and then suddenly found yourself 15 cents

underwater. In the face of a move as dynamic as that, which occurred in
soybeans on the 26th, it is likely that many traders exited in order to
conserve gains or to limit losses.

Once you have been forced out of a market by such a violent move, it is
difﬁcult to muster the conﬁdence to place a new trade. However, it is during
times like these, when market conﬁdence is lowest, that some of the greatest
opportunities are created.

When a market begins to move counter to the major auction, what is
most important is not a lone day’s structure; rather, how successful the
market is at moving counter to the trend. The initial day of counteractivity
may show directional conviction, but are subsequent days facilitating trade
and exhibiting follow-through? In other words, “Is the market doing a good
job in its attempts to go that way?” If not, the activity may be due to long-
term short covering (or long liquidation).

Figure 4.93 shows the soybean rally on January 26, as well as the Proﬁles
for the next seven trading days. After the strong rally, January 27 and 30
developed overlapping value areas just below the upper distribution of the
26th. If the soybean market was truly as strong as it had appeared to be on
the 26th, these balancing days would have developed closer to, or even
above, the January 26th 768 highs. February 1 and February 2 did manage to
auction higher and establish value above 768. However, after soybean
buyers had gained 30 cents in just one day, four more days of work netted
only 91/2 cents more. In addition, the fourth day (February 2) closed on its
lows below the January 26 highs. Figure 4.93 illustrates the selling that
continued through February 6. By the 9th, soybeans were again trading near
the 740 lows.

If you look at January 26 through February 2 in isolation and without the
beneﬁt of hindsight, the short-term trend does appear to be up and higher
value is developing. However, by overlaying the activity of each day onto the
previous day (beginning with the start of the rally), a different picture begins
to form. In Figure 4.95, we have combined the individual day timeframe
Proﬁles into a Long-Term Proﬁle.

Figure 4.95 shows the gradual development of long-term value in the
soybean market, beginning on January 26 and running through February 9.
These particular Long-Term Proﬁles were formed using the price/volume
data from the Liquidity Data Bank, although they may just as easily be
formed using TPOs. The number of Xs at a given price represents the
volume that occurred at that price, relative to the volumes occurring at all
other prices traded during the period selected. Thus, the Long-Term Proﬁle

for the January 26 to 31 period (four market days) shows the greatest value
(volume) building around 760. In addition, we have drawn a line separating
trade above and below 768, the January 26 high. Remember, the salient
feature to observe in order to identify short covering in any timeframe is
continuation. Any activity above the high for the 26th is indicative of buyer
continuation.

Through February 1, soybeans auction higher and begin to build value
above 768. However, continuation remains low relative to the magnitude of
the initial rally. By February 2, there has been no further buyer follow-
through, relative volume is beginning to decline above 768, and most
notable, a P formation is beginning to form. In effect, long-term buying
auctions are stalling, thus creating the noncontinuation structure found in
day timeframe short covering. Higher prices are cutting off activity as old
business has covered their shorts and new buyers have not entered the
market. This is the ﬁrst long-term structural indication of poor buyer
continuation. The buying in the soybean market, in this case, was likely
longer-term short covering, not healthy new initiative buying.

Applications

Suppose that you are one of the traders forced out of the market by the
covering. It has only been a few days, and the memory of the swift rally is no
doubt still fresh in your mind. If your intent is to reestablish your short
position, by February 3 the Long-Term Proﬁle provides some of the long-
term information you need in order to enter the market:
1. Risk is identiﬁed. If the soybean market returns up to trade above 7771/2
(7774), it is most likely caused by the actions of new, initiative other
timeframe buyers. Thus, shorts should be exited if price returns above
7771/2.

2. By February 2 and 3, buying auctions are subsiding as the short covering
diminishes and control reverts back to the other timeframe seller. This
transition phase is evidenced by the return of value below 768.

3. If the short covering is genuine, then soybeans should auction down to

take another look at the 740 lows.
At the right side of Figure 4.95, we have created a sequential Proﬁle in
which each time period represents a day (instead of half-hour auctions). This
long-term Proﬁle clearly exhibits the similarities between day and long-term
short covering. The quick initial rally in 1 period is followed by weak

buying-range extension attempts. Short-covering activity wanes and the
seller resumes control in 8 period, eventually ﬁlling in the lower half of the
Proﬁle.

& Corrective Action

Most great scientiﬁc discoveries are brought forth by a creative individual
who looks at something old in a new and innovative way. Often using the
same information that others have studied and researched for years, the
inventor simply sees the data in a different light. It is easy to become
entrenched in a mode of thinking or behavior. By locking our minds into a
single mindset, however, we often fail to question what we think are the
obvious answers.

Before we enter our discussion, take a minute to write down your ﬁrst

reaction to the following questions:
1. What do we mean when we say that a market needs to correct itself

(assuming that the current auction is up)?
2. What forms can this corrective action take?

A common dictionary deﬁnition of the term correction is counteraction.
For something to be corrected, an opposite action must take place. If
your thinking is locked into the generally accepted deﬁnition, you
might conceptualize a correction to be a situation where the market
auctions lower after a sustained rally, resulting in lower prices. Or, in a
larger timeframe sense, you may see a correction as a gradual sell-off
resulting in several days of lower prices. The point is, a typical stimulus
response to the question “What is correction after an up auction?” is often
simply that price needs to move lower. We, however, deﬁne correction
as counteraction. When viewed as counteraction, you will begin to see
that corrective action can take a more subtle, and perhaps more
powerful, form.

Traditionally, a correction after an up auction is assumed to be selling, or
proﬁt taking, that results in lower prices. This is not always true. Even
though there are sellers in the market covering longs after an up auction,
price does not necessarily have to fall. For example, a market may open higher
and sell off all day, resulting in higher prices, higher value, and a higher
close. On such a day, correction can still be taking place even though lower
prices are not evident.

This sort of correction occurs when old buyers sell, taking their proﬁts at
the same time new buyers are just deciding to enter the market. Thus,
responsive selling (proﬁt taking) is met by initiative buyers entering new
positions. If the initiative buying is strong enough, price may remain higher
despite old businesses liquidating their original positions. Remember,
however, that when the responsive seller is able to exert more inﬂuence
on price than the initiative buyer, the up auction may be over (refer to
“Bracketed Markets” in Chapter 3).

The Function of Corrective Action

Corrective action serves several purposes. First, it allows for proﬁt taking—
a vital ingredient in maintaining a healthy market. Proﬁt taking eases the
anxiety level of the market. Naturally, traders with well-placed trades often
build up high levels of anxiety about being able to keep their proﬁts. The way
to reduce this worry and nervousness is to lock in your proﬁt—to sell if price
has been going up or to buy if price has been going down.

More important, counteraction also serves as a test of the strength of the
buyer (or seller). If a correction is occurring in an up auction and the market
still manages to establish higher value, then the underlying market condi-
tions are very strong. A textbook example of such corrective action is
provided by Treasury bonds in Figure 4.96.

Following a higher opening, traders holding longs were given ample time
to sell all they wanted. The resulting selling-range extension and Normal
Variation selling structure suggests that this is exactly what happened.
Although lower prices were not the result, this selling is nonetheless a
counteraction to the buying that had been occurring over the previous three
days. Reviewing the Treasury bond activity prior to August 30, excess was
created on August 25, which ultimately marked the beginning of an up
auction. As the bar chart windowed inside Figure 4.96 shows, the buying
auction continued with a breakout above a previous short-term high at 85 to
11. On August 30, the market opened above value and attempted to trade
lower most of the session (until J period). However, the resulting value area
and close were actually higher than the previous day. As the activity of
subsequent days proved, within the sell-off of August 30 was the well-
disguised correction for which alert buyers had been waiting.

Corrective action is important to the health of a trend. The fact that
corrective selling attempts occurred at the same time value was being
established higher indicated that the bond market was exceptionally strong.

Old buyers had ample time to liquidate their positions at a favorable price,
and new buyers had plenty of opportunity to place longs with good day
timeframe trade location. Conventional traders relying mainly on price
might not have recognized the correction, and instead reacted to the sell-off

3GC04

after the open by entering short positions. As Figure 4.96 shows, any short
positions on this day soon became losing trades.

Whether talking about corrective action or any other natural market
function, it is important to keep in mind that the most obvious behavioral
clues, such as lower prices, are not always available. On August 30, creative,
open-minded traders probably recognized that price did not have to go
lower for a correction to take place.

Summary
Being able to identify corrective action without the beneﬁt of an obvious
price break or rally requires a level of creativity that can only come from the
trader who is willing and able to look at the same information from more
than one angle. Objectivity stretches far beyond this one isolated instance,
however. Futures trading presents us with a formidable variety of such
situations every day. As we gain more experience and draw closer to the
levels of proﬁcient and expert, our goal is to begin to consistently see the
unusual—to develop the open-minded-ness that allows us to identify and
take advantage of the unique trading opportunities that arise when the
market deviates from the norm.

& Long-Term Proﬁles

The truth knocks on the door and you say, “Go away, I’m looking for
the truth,” and so it goes away.

From Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert Pirsig

In today’s complex world, we are continually confronted by the ever-
changing demands and inﬂuences of society. It is difﬁcult to remain cooly
objective in the face of the shifting images produced by public opinion, the
media, and noted ﬁnancial experts. Occasionally, everyone gets caught up and
loses sight of the big picture—whether it be in one’s profession, family life, or
trading. In such cases, it is easy to miss the proverbial forest for the trees, to tell
truth to go away when it should be as obvious as a knock on the door.

How many times have you gotten so involved with the individual, day-to-
day auctions that you lost sight of the real market? When you focus on the
individual trees, you lose the long-term big picture. What is needed is a
consistent method of recording the long-term auctions so that they can be

observed objectively. A Long-Term Proﬁle simply plots greater units of
time in relation to price in order to form a long-term version of the day
timeframe Market Proﬁle.

The salient concept behind the Long-Term Proﬁle is the fact that the
principles of the market’s auction process apply to all timeframes, from the
shortest time period to the long-term auctions. Just as each day’s Proﬁle is
composed of a series of half-hour auctions, a weeklong Proﬁle would be
composed of ﬁve-day timeframe Proﬁles. It follows then, that a Long-Term
Proﬁle develops the same structural manifestations of market activity, such
as gaps, brackets, trends, high and low volume areas, excess, and tails.
Shown in Figure 4.97 are a typical day timeframe Proﬁle, a 10-day Swing
Proﬁle, and a one month, Long-Term Proﬁle. Notice the strikingly similar
characteristics. To make the distributions appear more generic, the indi-
vidually lettered TPOs have been replaced with common Xs.

Using Long-Term Proﬁles
The main strength of the Long-Term Proﬁle lies in the clear deﬁnition of
brackets and the migration of value. It not only provides a visual picture of
the long-term structures of the market but also enables you to easily monitor
elements that signify change. By identifying changing conditions through the
Long-Term Proﬁle, long-term traders are prepared to act in the early stages
of opportunity.

Theoretically, if a Long-Term Proﬁle was accumulated indeﬁnitely, the
ultimate result would be a giant, normal distribution curve that is of little
value to anyone. Thus, to use the Long-Term Proﬁle effectively, you need to
begin building the Proﬁle when a signiﬁcant long-term change has occurred,
such as a long-term high or low. As you witness signiﬁcant market changes
that inﬂuence your particular timeframe, you might consider a running
Long-Term Proﬁle, starting at the point of change in order to better evaluate
continuation. When the market enters a new period marked by conﬁrmed
long-term change, you should begin a new Long-Term Proﬁle. It is wise to
keep your past Proﬁles as well, in order to keep track of long-term reference
points that might have an effect on future auctions.

The Long-Term Proﬁle in Action

timeframes throughout the book. In this section, we present an ongoing

analysis of a Long-Term Proﬁle for the Japanese yen during the ﬁrst few
months of 1989. The aim is to demonstrate how the Long-Term Proﬁle
traders
accurately pinpoints the key long-term reference points that
commonly attempt to glean from a daily bar chart. In addition, we
show that through the added dimension of time (TPOs), the success of
the long-term auction is easily discernible through a Long-Term Proﬁle.
This period in the yen is particularly useful, because it also illustrates how
markets evolve from trend, to bracket, then back to trend again (see “Trending
versus Bracketed Markets” in Chapter 3). The example displays the usefulness
of the Long-Term Proﬁle during both types of market conditions.

The analysis is segmented into two regions. Each region is accompanied
by a Long-Term Proﬁle and the daily bar chart for the corresponding period
of time.

Region A (Figures 4.98 and 4.99) Region A displays a long-term selling
trend that began with a breakout of a short-term bracket and then slowed
when the market eventually came into balance near the .7600 level. Point 1
in the bar chart shows several volatile but basically overlapping days
occurring in the .8000 to .8100 region. Point 1 on the Long-Term Proﬁle
vividly depicts the bracket resulting from this balancing process. Notice how
the Long-Term Proﬁle displays the bracket in a well-deﬁned high-volume
area bound by long-term tails (Figure 4.99, points 1a and 1b). Just like a day
timeframe Proﬁle, high volume represents acceptance and serves to attract
price. The low-volume extremes indicate strong responsive other timeframe
presence at the bracket top and bottom.

The yen broke below the bracket with the sharp selling gap denoted by
point 2. The gap is represented on the Long-Term Proﬁle by the single prints
directly below the bracketed region at point 1. (This particular Long-Term
Proﬁle assumes that some degree of trade took place and therefore records
single prints in the area of the gap.) The excess created by the gap gave other
timeframe sellers the conﬁdence they needed to initiate the selling trend
denoted by point 3. During a trend, the Long-Term Proﬁle exhibits
relatively low volume and elongated structure. In the bar chart, the trend
is witnessed by the steady progression of lower prices.

After another selling gap at point 4 (the gap is less evident through the
Long-Term Proﬁle, because the yen had actually traded in the region of the
gap four days earlier), the yen entered the second balanced area (point 5)
evidenced by a high-volume region in the Long-Term Proﬁle. This particular
bracketing phase was caused by central bank intervention to slow the U.S.

dollar’s rise (which had a supportive effect on the yen). Note, however, that
the long-term point of control continued to fall (Figure 4.99, points 5a, b,
and c), indicating the long-term seller remained in control and was gradually
establishing lower value. While strong excess above the bracket is shown by
the Long-Term Proﬁle through the gap and accompanying low volume at
point 4, the lower extreme of the bracket does not display the aggressive
rejection indicative of a high-conﬁdence low.

showed a signiﬁcant accumulation of volume at any lone price. The trend is
obvious in the bar chart. Two “acceleration” selling gaps, at points 9 and
10, present in both the bar chart and through the low-volume areas in the
Long-Term Proﬁle, illustrate just how quickly this market is auctioning
through time.

Summary The Long-Term Proﬁle vividly illustrates how the auction
process is the same in all timeframes. Just as changes in other timeframe
control are evident in day timeframe auctions and structural development,
the Long-Term Proﬁle reveals other timeframe activity in a big-picture sense
through the evaluation of high- and low-volume areas.

& Special Situations

A high school teacher tells the story of a frustrating day in his career. He was
lecturing on the bravery of the American soldiers during the ﬁght for
independence. On this particular day, he became quite dramatic and
descriptive, vividly portraying the battleﬁelds and the courage of our
forefathers. He described the freezing cold winter, the meager rations,
and the eloquent words of Washington that kept the men’s spirits high. The
teacher was trying to give his students a feeling for what it was like to ﬁght
for one’s country, the self-sacriﬁce that led to our freedom from England so
many years ago.

The class was nearing its end when a student raised his hand. “Yes,” the

teacher said.

“Will this be on the test?” he asked.
The teacher was trying to give his students an understanding of the cost of
freedom, but the boy who raised his hand was so worried about what he had
to know for the test that he missed the point entirely. The student wanted to
be given the answers. He did not want to have to actively think for himself.
By focusing on what he thought he had to know, he did not hear what the
instructor was really teaching.

It would be nice to know the answers, to rely on a little certainty. We
would all be rich and successful if someone would come up with an answer
that would tell us when to buy and when to sell. But if we are dogmatically
given the answers, we will never truly understand their roots. In the words of
Heraclitus, “Much learning does not teach understanding.” Many traders do
not want to actively think and make their own decisions. They want steadfast
rules to guide their trading.

However, market-generated information, when observed and inter-
preted through the Market Proﬁle, will at times reveal unique situations
that offer a high degree of certainty. We call these high-probability
occurrences Special Situations. We will introduce six of these market-
created opportunities. They are:
1. 3 to I days
2. Neutral-Extreme days
3. The Value-Area Rule
4. Spikes
5. Balance-area breakouts
6. Gaps

There are no guarantees, but one of the comforts of a Special Situation is
the identiﬁcation of a mechanical trade—a trade that almost has to be done
(under the right market conditions). And, while the limited studies that
we have performed reveal encouraging results, it is important to note that
the success of a Special Situation trade lies in the trader’s understanding of the
market conditions inﬂuencing that trade.

3 to I Days

Probably the best-known Special Situation is the 3 to I day. A 3 to I day is
characterized by an initiative tail, TPO count, and range extension. Thus, a 3
to I buying day would show an initiative buying tail, initiative buying TPOs,
and initiative buying range extension. Figure 4.102 displays a 3 to I Buying
Trend day in soybeans (TPOs always favor the trend).

Over a large sample size, the trading session following a 3 to I buying day
should open within value or higher. Thus, traders holding longs placed
within the previous day’s value area should have an opportunity to exit
within the same region (the opposite applies to a 3 to I selling day). In sum, 3
to I days often provide an opportunity to hold a highly leveraged position
while incurring minimal risk.

We conducted a limited study evaluating the opportunity embodied in 3
to I days by observing their continuation into the ﬁrst 90 minutes of the
following trading session as well as through to the day’s close. Speciﬁcally,
we recorded whether the subsequent day’s trading took place at prices
better than, within, or worse than the previous day’s value area. For
example, if the day following a 3 to I Buying day opened higher, then activity
was given a better reading for the initial 90 minutes of trade. Conversely, if

the session following a 3 to I Buying day closed below the previous day’s
value area, then it was given a worse reading in the Next Day’s Close
category. For purposes of the study, we also examined 2I to 1R days—days
possessing a responsive buying tail
instead of an initiative buying tail
(Figure 4.103). The results, compiled from Treasury bond data over the
June 24, 1986, to May 29, 1987, period follow Figure 4.103.

The results suggest that, over the period studied, 3 to I and 2I to 1R
structure identiﬁed relatively low-risk trading opportunities with astounding
reliability. We note, however, that these ﬁndings are derived from one
market studied over a limited period of time. Other markets behave
differently, and all markets change over time. A few of the signiﬁcant
ﬁndings are highlighted below.
1. In 94 percent of the days following a 3 to I day, the market traded at
prices better than the previous day’s value area during the ﬁrst 90 minutes
of trading (higher on 3 to I Buying days and lower on 3 to I Selling days).
This ﬁgure was 71 percent following 2I to 1R days.

2. In every case the market allowed time for a trader to exit trades without
loss. However, it is important to note that in a few cases the opportunity
did not last for long.

3. Some 59 percent of the days following a 3 to I day closed at prices better
than the previous day’s value area, while only 3 percent closed worse. In
all, 97 percent of the days following a 3 to I day closed within or better
than the previous day’s value area. For 2I to 1R days, this ﬁgure
measured 82 percent, with 18 percent closing worse.
A 3 to I develops when three speciﬁc factors indicating a day’s attempted
direction—tails, range extension, and TPOs—all point the same way.
When these three elements are generated in unison, they alert the trader to
the potential for a high-probability trade, a trade that almost has to be done.

Neutral-Extreme Days

A Neutral day indicates day timeframe balance and is characterized by range
extension on both sides of the initial balance. In a sense, both other
timeframe participants are active in a day timeframe vertical tug-of-war.
If the market closes near the middle of the range, then control is even. If,
however, the close occurs on one of the day’s extremes, there is a clear
victor, and the following day is likely to open in the direction of the closing
activity.

To test this Special Situation, we studied Treasury bond activity from
June 24, 1986, to August 12, 1987. Like the 3 to I day, we evaluated
Neutral-Extreme days for their continuation into the ﬁrst 90 minutes of the
following session, and also through to the day’s close. Over the yearlong
study, the continuation properties of the Neutral-Extreme days were almost
as impressive as those represented by 3 to I days.

In 92 percent of the cases studied, the market traded within or above the
previous day’s value area during the initial 90 minutes of trade. Sixty-four
percent of the time this activity occurred above the value area during a
Neutral day closing on the highs, or below the value area on a Neutral day
closing on the lows. These ﬁgures dropped to 73 percent and 45 percent,
respectively, when compared to the following day’s close.

In terms of trading applications, suppose that Neutral structure develops,
and it is apparent that the market will close near the highs. A long placed
within the value area will usually offer good trade location into the following
day. In the majority of cases, you will have time to monitor early activity for

continuation during the next day. If directional conviction reverses, 92 per-
cent of the time you will have an opportunity to exit your long within the
previous day’s value area.

Again, we note that that these ﬁndings are derived from one market
studied over a limited period of time. Other markets behave differently and
all markets change over time.

The Value-Area Rule

We have mentioned many times the slowing properties of volume. Unless
something signiﬁcant has changed, price movement will often slow upon
reentering an area of previously accepted high volume, as the market spends
time trading there again.

The value area represents the range where the greatest volume of trade
took place in the day timeframe. If the market opens outside the value area
on the following day, then the previous day’s value area has been rejected by
other timeframe participants. Due to the presence of the other timeframe
participants who caused the initial rejection, the top of the previous day’s
value area generally provides support against price probes back down into
value, and the bottom of the value area will offer resistance against auction
attempts to the upside. However, if price should be accepted (double TPO prints)
within the previous day’s value area, there is a good possibility that the market will
auction completely through that value area. We have deemed this Special
Situation the Value-Area Rule.

Entering an area of established value represents a test of the market’s
most recent assessment of value. If the test results in acceptance, it is only
logical that market participants will conduct trade throughout that region of
value. For example, in Figure 4.104, the soybean market opened below the
previous day’s value area, reentered value and proceeded to trade com-
pletely through it, closing on the high.

Monitoring the market’s close after value has been penetrated and price
has auctioned all the way through is a subtle nuance of the Value Area Rule.
If the market opens lower and trades up through the previous trading
session’s value area, a close on the highs is an indication of market strength
(just as a close on the lows below the previous day’s value area after a higher
open is a sign of market weakness). On the day following our soybeans
example in Figure 4.104, the market had to trade higher to ﬁnd sellers and
cut off buying.

The Value-Area Rule does not suggest that every time the market pierces
the bottom of the previous day’s value area (from below) you should blindly
buy. It is equally important to objectively evaluate overall market conditions
and speciﬁc circumstances before employing a Special Situation trade. The
following considerations should be taken into account before executing a
Value-Area Rule trade:
1. Distance from Value. The closer a market opens to the previous day’s value
area, the greater the chances of it penetrating and traveling through that
value area. The logic behind this lies in the concept of market balance. A
market that opens within range or value is in relative balance, thus
perceptions of value have not changed signiﬁcantly, and there is a good
probability that trade will be conducted within the same value area.
Conversely, if a market opens away from accepted value, it is out of
balance. Therefore, the market is less likely to return to trade in the
previous day’s value area, since the forces that caused the imbalance have
altered the underlying condition of the market. We caution, however,
that if such a breakout of balance should be rejected by responsive
participants, the return to value could be sudden and forceful, to the
point that price auctions straight through the value area and completely
through the previous day’s range.

2. Value-Area Width. Narrow value is a sign of poor trade facilitation and
lower volume. Because volume slows price, narrow value areas are more
easily traversed than wider, high-volume value areas. Therefore, the
Value-Area Rule carries a higher probability when price enters a narrow
value area.

3. Market Direction. The direction of the current long-term auction has an
obvious inﬂuence on the momentum, or strength behind the value-area
penetration. When price auctions up into value during a buying trend,
for example, the chances for continuation are much better than if the
market were in a downward trend.

Summary

If a trader enters a Value-Area Rule trade without evaluating other market
conditions, the probability that price will trade all the way through the value
area is little better than a ﬂip of a coin. The power of the Value-Area Rule
lies in your interpretation of surrounding market conditions. Through an
understanding of the conﬂuence of balance, value-area width, and market

direction, you can identify the situations during which the Value-Area Rule
offers a high degree of reliability.

& Spikes

A spike is generated when price trends swiftly away from established
value during the last few time periods of a trading session. Speciﬁcally, a
spike begins with the time period marking the breakout. For example, in
Figure 4.105 the S&P market broke away from value during N period on
May 5. Therefore, the spike’s range extends from the top of N period
(311.00) down to the day’s low at 308.00.

Ordinarily, a breakout from value can be monitored for continuation in
following time periods. However, when it occurs at or near the end of the
trading day, the crucial element of time (Price (cid:4) Time ¼ Value) is absent.
Thus, the trader must wait until the next day to judge the price movement
for follow-through and conviction. Where the market opens and subse-
quently builds value relative to the previous day’s spike sends clear signals
regarding the underlying directional conviction of the market.

Acceptance versus Rejection

Whenever price moves quickly away from value, it takes time to validate the
new levels. If price subsequently slows, allowing volume to “catch up” and
TPOs to accumulate, then value has been accepted at the new price levels.
Thus, a market that opens within a spike created during the previous day
indicates conﬁrmation of that area. The price spike is also accepted if the
following day opens beyond the spike—above a buying spike or below a
selling spike. An open in the direction of the spike indicates the probe is not
yet over. The market will likely continue to auction in the direction of the
spike, seeking new value.

Conversely, a spike is rejected if the subsequent trading session opens in the
opposite direction from the spike. For example, after a buying spike, an
open below the base of the spike would constitute rejection of the upward
price probe.

Openings within the Spike

An opening within the spike indicates that the market is balancing. Thus,
two-timeframe, rotational trade will likely develop within or near the

spike’s range for the duration of the day. In Figure 4.105, for example, the
S&P market opened at 308.20 on May 8, 1989—within the 308.00 to
311.00 selling spike created on the previous trading day. The market then
balanced, conﬁrming the previous day’s probe to lower value. In a second
example in Figure 4.106, the S&P opened at the bottom of the May 2 selling
spike. Price auctioned higher and found resistance near the spike’s highs
(311.00), providing several opportunities for alert traders to place shorts
with good day timeframe trade location.

On a side note, during days that open and accept value within a spike
generated on the previous day, we use a variation of the Range Estimation
rules (introduced in Section I) to estimate the day’s range. Normally, the
entire previous day’s range is used to estimate the current day’s range
potential. In the case of an open within a spike, however, the spike is treated
like a “new day.” Thus, when estimating the range on a day that opens within
a previous day’s spike, we use the length of the spike as our estimate, not the
whole day’s range. In Figure 4.106, for example, the spike on May 2 extends
from 311.30 (the top of the breakout period) to 309.30, a range of 200
points. The following day recorded a range just one tick short of 200 points.

Openings outside the Spike

Whenever a market opens outside the previous day’s range, the market is
out of balance. The same general rule applies to openings beyond the spike’s
range, but the magnitude of the imbalance varies depending on where the
market opens relative to the direction of the spike.

Bullish Openings An open above a buying spike signiﬁes a market that is
extremely out of balance—initiative buyers are in obvious control. Ideally, a
trader should seek to place longs near the support offered by the top of the
spike. In Figure 4.107, crude oil opened above the price spike on the 3rd and
established substantially higher value. The opportunity to secure excellent
trade location for longs was created when B period met resistance at the
20.15 spike top. Be aware, however, that if the market should auction down
into the spike, thus negating its supportive top, price could move very
quickly.

When the market opens above a selling spike (rejects the spike), sentiment
is still bullish for the day timeframe, but for different reasons. This sort of
conﬂicting activity often occurs when price has gotten ahead of the market,
inviting the responsive participant to auction price back into previously

perceived value. A case in point is crude oil activity following a selling spike
on May 8th. On May 9th, crude oil opened above the 8th’s 19.36 to 19.60
selling spike (Figure 4.108). After auctioning down three ticks and ﬁnding
strong support at the top of the spike, the market auctioned higher for the
remainder of the day.

Bearish Openings When a market opens below a selling spike, day time-
frame sentiment is extremely bearish, as is the case with Crude Oil in Figure
4.109. When crude oil opened below the spike, traders were alerted that
the previous day’s selling spike was leading value. The eventual development
of a selling Trend day exhibited the clear acceptance of lower prices. An
open below a buying spike represents rejection of the spike and is also bearish
for the day timeframe, but not to the extent of the scenario outlined above.

Spike Reference Points During the trading session following a price
spike, the spike’s extremes often provide useful day timeframe reference
points (Figure 4.110). After a higher open, for example, auction rotations
are often supported by the spike’s top. Similarly, the bottom of a price
spike offers resistance on days that open lower. However, it is important to
note that the spike extremes are only valid reference points for the ﬁrst price
probe into the spike. If the market returns to test the spike several times in
the same half-hour time period, then the chances are good that price will
eventually auction through the spike extreme. An additional test into the
price spike in a subsequent time period would create double TPOs, in effect
establishing value within the spike. In crude oil on the 8th (Figure 4.109),
double TPO prints above the 19.98 spike bottom would negate its reliability
as a resistance level.

& Balance-Area Breakouts

Imagine a large stone precariously balanced on a mountain peak. In a gale
force wind, the stone might come loose and tumble down the mountainside.
When it falls, it falls quickly in one direction. If the wind is less forceful, the
stone may rock to one side and then tumble in the other direction. A
balanced market acts in a similar fashion. And, ﬁnancially speaking, a market
that is breaking out of balance can be just as dangerous as a falling rock.
The identiﬁcation of a balance area depends largely on your timeframe.
For example, a ledge (see Section I) may constitute a balance area to a day

trader. To a swing trader, however, a balance area might be ﬁve days of
overlapping value. A long-term trader might consider a major bracket to be
a balance area. When something upsets the balance, price moves are often
sudden and forceful.

Balance area breakout strategy is straightforward—go with the breakout.
Thus, if price is accepted outside the balance area, place trades in the
direction of the new activity. In Figure 4.111, Treasury bonds had recorded
basically eight days of overlapping value within a relatively well-deﬁned

balance region spanning from 97 to 03 to 98 to 16. On April 9, a narrow
initial balance forming near the short-term bracket low alerted traders to a
potential Double Distribution Trend day. When C period broke below the
balance-area lows set on April 3 at 97 to 32, traders should have entered
short positions. Buy (exit) stops should have been placed a few ticks above
the point of breakout, for a price return into the balance area would indicate
rejection by responsive buyers.

Occasionally, the market rocks one way, then breaksout in the opposite
direction. This sort of activity often occurs when the locals or short-term
traders auction price beyond a known reference point (in this case a balance-
area high or low), to see if there is new activity to sustain the price

movement. If there is no response, then the opposite participant can enter
the market with conﬁdence, driving price with strong directional conviction.
On February 6 in Figure 4.112, price auctions below the three days of
overlapping value in the S&P market. Since the rule of this Special Situation
is to go with the breakout, traders should have been short when D period
auctioned below 297.20. When no follow-through developed and price
traded back into the balance area, however, shorts should have been exited
at minimal loss. With the knowledge that there was no activity below the
lows, traders should have been prepared to buy a breakout to the upside,
which occurred on the following day at 300.40. A balance-area breakout is a

trade you “almost have to do.” Risk is minimal and proﬁt potential is very
high.

In hindsight, a balance-area breakout trade looks like such an easy trade to
make. However, when you have spent the last few days watching price move
sideways, it is not so easy to enter the market initiatively. It feels as if the
trade is late, for technically, better trade location could have been secured
on previous days. In reality, a breakout is usually the start of a much bigger
move, and trades placed with the initiator are ultimately early. Taking
advantage of these market-created opportunities is essential to gaining the
conﬁdence and experience that are vital to becoming a competent trader.

& Gaps

The last Special Situation we will discuss is the gap. A gap is an opening
outside the previous day’s range, signifying a market out of balance. A gap
is created when the other timeframe perceives price to be away from value
and enters the market aggressively, forming excess in the form of an
“invisible tail.” The salient feature of a gap (that holds) is that it should
offer signiﬁcant support or resistance to price, and it therefore stands as a
valuable guide for day traders and an important reference point for long-
term traders.

Gaps fall into three broad categories: (1) Break-away gaps, (2) Acceleration
gaps, and (3) Exhaustion gaps. Brieﬂy, a Break-away gap occurs when the
market is in the early stages of a long-term trend. This sort of gap is fueled by
new, initiative other timeframe participants possessing strong directional
conviction. An Acceleration gap develops within a trend and reafﬁrms the
conviction and strength of the trend’s direction. Finally, an Exhaustion gap
will sometimes mark the end of a trend. In the ﬁnal stages of a buying trend,
for example, more and more participants are gradually convinced that the
market is indeed trending. Eventually, practically everyone is a buyer. The
ﬁnal consensus is so strong that the market gaps higher as the last doubters
jump on board. Once everyone is long, however, there is no one left to buy
and the trend is effectively over.

Whether or not a gap is a Break-away, Acceleration, or Exhaustion gap
will greatly inﬂuence the likelihood that it will hold. However, what we are
concerned with here is the Special Situation properties of gaps. Thus, the
following discussion treats all gaps the same by evaluating each in the present
tense.

Day Timeframe Signiﬁcance of Gaps
Generally speaking, most gaps are eventually ﬁlled—some on the same day.
In the day timeframe, if a gap is going to be retraced (ﬁlled) by responsive
participants, the rejection will usually ﬁll the gap within the ﬁrst hour. The
longer a gap holds, the greater the probability of its continuation.

The Special Situation rule for trading gaps is to trade with the initiative
activity that caused the gap, placing stops at the point where a price
rotation would effectively erase the gap by trading completely through it.
Figure 4.113 represents an ideal gap trade in crude oil. Shorts placed in the
ﬁrst half hour of trade with the gap lower and subsequent Open-Drive

activity resulted in good trade location during a selling Trend day. Shorts
should have been exited if price had ﬁlled the gap by trading back above
19.98.

Not all gap days are quite so ideal, however. Like the Value-Area Rule,
there are outside factors that inﬂuence the way a gap should be traded. In
Figure 4.114, the Swiss franc opened 26 ticks below the previous trading
session’s low. Such an extreme gap should have alerted traders to the
possible entry of the responsive buyer. The farther away from the previous
day’s range a market opens, the greater the likelihood that the market has
temporarily overextended itself. When this occurs, the responsive partici-
pant will often narrow the gap by auctioning price toward the previous
day’s value. When a market gaps signiﬁcantly away from the previous day’s
range, the prudent action is to monitor activity soon after the open before
placing trades. In the case of the Swiss franc in Figure 4.114, if the responsive
buyer enters, traders should wait until the initiative seller reappears,
monitoring the gap for support. When responsive activity waned and
two-timeframe trade developed with the downward rotation in A period,
shorts should have been entered and buy stops placed at 59.87 (the gap
erasure point).

Again, successfully using Special Situations involves a synthesis of market
understanding, time, and experience. It is difﬁcult to explain the ideal point
at which a gap trade should be entered. In many cases, blindly placing a trade
in the direction of the gap will eventually result in a successful trade.
However, without monitoring early activity, a trade placed too early might
suffer undue exposure if price temporarily auctions against the position.
Starting out with poor trade location can be both ﬁnancially and mentally
taxing, often to the point that the trader is forced to exit what would have
developed into a good trade. Our Swiss franc example provides a good
example of how this can occur. A trader who sold immediately with the
selling gap could easily have been forced out of his or her short position,
given that the Swiss auctioned against the position for better than the ﬁrst
half hour of trade. Traders who anticipated responsive buying after such a
sharp break from value would have probably waited for a return of the
selling auctions before entering shorts. With the responsive buying over (at
least temporarily), traders placing short positions would have had more
conﬁdence, and therefore a better chance at completing a successful trade. In
this case, notice that both scenarios would have ended in similar trade
location. The difference between the two trades is the level of accompanying
anxiety.

Gaps do not hold every time. On some occasions, the buying or selling
auction that produced the gap will fail, inviting responsive participants to
return price to previous value. When this occurs, however, there are usually
clear signs that the gap will be erased. In the case of the gold market in
Figure 4.115, gold gapped below the previous day’s range. After a quick test

3GC04

to the downside, the responsive buyer entered and drove price up through
the gap and into the value area of April 28th. All of this activity occurred
during the ﬁrst half hour of trade. Traders who sold with the selling gap
should have covered when gold auctioned above 379.60 in Y period.

Gaps are created by aggressive other timeframe activity. They are
signiﬁcant reference points as long as they hold. If, however, responsive
participants overcome the initiator and return price through the gap, then
conditions have changed and the gap is no longer a signiﬁcant trading guide.

Summary

Special Situations are not fail-safe answers, but they do offer a trader some
degree of comfort and security. Still, your imagination should not stop at these
limited examples. By incorporating the different methods for evaluating
directional conviction and performance, a trader can identify other circum-
stances that offer high leverage and low risk. To put it simply, the big picture
is made up of many small, more speciﬁc components. By synthesizing
these factors into a more all-encompassing market understanding, you will
increase your chances of success. Consistently successful trading is the result of
a unique combination of opportunity, experience, and market understanding.

& Markets to Stay Out Of

Special Situations are useful for identifying trading opportunities that possess
a relatively high degree of security. On the opposite end of the spectrum,
but no less important, are those times when one simply should not trade at
all. A trader who forces a trade when there is no real opportunity in the
market is like a basketball player who forces a shot when he is off-balance or
heavily guarded—the chances of scoring are low. A good basketball player
who does not have a clear shot will generally not shoot the ball. Similarly,
experienced traders who do not see a clear market opportunity do not
force the trade. The harder you have to look, the lower the potential for a
good trade. In such a situation, it is best to stand aside and wait for an
opportunity to develop.

The following discussion covers four market situations that signify the

existence of relatively little trading opportunity:
1. Nontrend days
2. Nonconviction days

3. Long-term nontrend markets
4. News-inﬂuenced markets

Nontrend Days

The most obvious market to stay out of is the Nontrend day. On a Non-
trend day, the market is not facilitating trade with any participant and
opportunity is low, for the day’s range is small and activity is scarce.
Figure 4.116 shows a typical, low-volume Nontrend day that occurred in
bonds on May 8, 1989.

Nonconviction Days

A less obvious type of low opportunity market is a Nonconviction day.
Structurally, a Nonconviction day often appears to be no different than a
Normal, Normal Variation, or Neutral day. However, the Nonconviction
day exhibits none of the other timeframe directional conviction that these
standard day types typically display—there are no recognizable reference
points for a day timeframe trader. During a Nonconviction day, the open is
often of the Open-Auction variety, occurring within the previous day’s value
area. Price rotates randomly back and forth with very little conﬁdence
throughout the day.

In hindsight, a Nonconviction day’s range can be misleading, for it
appears as if a number of good opportunities should have been generated as
the day progressed. In the thick of such low-conﬁdence activity, however,
traders are provided no real reference points by which to base their trading
decision. Consequently, traders often end up forcing trades that just aren’t
there.

Figure 4.117 provides a good example of a Nonconviction day in the gold
market. After an Open-Auction, gold spent the remainder of the trading
session auctioning back and forth with no apparent directional conviction.
The completed Proﬁle looks like a Normal Variation day, but at no point
was there a clear indication of other timeframe presence. On such a day, it is
relatively easy to lose objectivity due to the lack of market sentiment. When
a Nonconviction day develops, it is best to stay out of the market altogether,
for any trading decision would be based on conjecture and random price
rotations.

Long-Term Nontrend Markets

On a larger scale, long-term activity may at times exhibit a lack of
directional conviction. While long-term traders should not have positions
in the market, there may still be plenty of opportunity for day timeframe
traders. In Figure 4.118, for example, crude oil exhibited extremely erratic

behavior for several weeks, auctioning back and forth with no long-term
conviction. Although this was clearly a market to be avoided by long-term
traders, the resulting price spikes and gaps offered several high-percentage
trades for day timeframe traders.

News-Inﬂuenced Markets

The ﬁnal “stand-aside” scenario is a day prior to a major news announce-
ment. Generally, many other timeframe participants have balanced their
positions prior to a scheduled news announcement. Thus, the day or two just
prior to the news is often left in the hands of the locals and other shorter-
term traders. The resulting low-volume environment can be dangerous, for
rumors and predictions can cause price to rotate wildly.

Summary

Staying out of a market is more difﬁcult than it sounds. When there are few
clues regarding directional conviction, it is easy to lose objectivity. Sitting in
front of a quote monitor all day without placing a trade requires a
tremendous amount of patience. Even the most experienced traders begin
to hear that little subjective voice: “It has got to break. TPOs favor sellers
sell it.” When the market has no conﬁdence, stand aside until new
. . .
activity develops. Not only do bad trades lead to losses, but they also keep you
from entering a good trade when opportune conditions ﬁnally arise.

& News

The release of a major news announcement (such as Gross National Product,
Merchandise Trade, or Producer Price Index) often creates a violent knee-
jerk reaction by the market’s participants. Trying to anticipate the news
item and how it will affect market sentiment is a highly dangerous gamble.
Once the news information is out, price moves so violently and with such
speed that it is nearly impossible to make a rational trading decision (or
locate your trade where you want it). This is due to the manner in which the
news is generally announced. The initial number usually causes a sudden
price reaction, depending on early estimates that form market opinion. Soon
after the actual announcement, however, there is often a revision of previous
periods’ ﬁgures, which can cause further erratic movement. Finally, the
components that make up the economic ﬁgure come out, often causing yet

another reaction to the number. All of this activity takes place in an
extremely short period of time. The resulting sporadic price spurts can wipe
out a substantial amount of capital in minutes.

Long before a piece of news is ever announced, the market’s participants
form expectations that begin to inﬂuence market activity. The consensus
opinion (available in Barron’s and various news sources) is, in effect, built into
the market prior to the news announcement. If a trader is aware of the
market’s preconceived notions regarding the pending news, then he or
she can evaluate the true strength or weakness of the market by observing
the reaction to the actual numbers.

Let us look at a real market example. Before the Producer Price Index
(PPI) was announced on May 12, 1989, the bond market was expecting a
number between þ.06 percent and þ.08 percent. Due to bearish expect-
ations, bonds had been in a short-term down auction, as evidenced by point
1 in Figure 4.119. The direction of the major auction, however, was up
(point 2). The actual number released was þ.04 percent, which indicated
lower inﬂation than expected, a bullish sign for bonds. The market
immediately rallied some 16 ticks (Figure 4.120). Shortly after, it was
announced that an increase in oil contributed þ.07 percent of the ﬁgure.
Thus, had it not been for oil, the PPI would have actually been negative. This
extremely bullish news caused bonds to rally nearly two full points to 90 to
26. Many market participants lost money because they had anticipated a
bearish number. It is extremely difﬁcult to trade during the volatility created
by a news announcement.

Traders could have gained valuable information on the 12th if they had

entered the market prepared with the following information:
1. Direction of the major auction.
2. Known reference points.
3. Market expectations for a scheduled news announcement.

The direction of the major auction was up, despite the short-term selling
rotation due to bearish expectations. The market had broken below several
days of overlapping value (not in view) on May 9, establishing two important
reference points: the 9th’s high (89 to 16) and the point at which the market
broke lower (89 to 04). As previously mentioned, the consensus opinion was
that the PPI should have been between þ.06 percent and þ.08 percent.
When the number was announced as bullish for bonds, the market auctioned
through the ﬁrst reference point (point 1 in Figure 4.120) easily, and slowed
at the highs for the 9th (point 2). The subsequent announcement of the PPI’s

components was also bullish, and the market exploded to the upside.
Despite the recent down auction, bonds had no trouble auctioning two
points higher on May 9. It became apparent that underlying market
conditions were strong.

The following list displays the basic news/market sentiment relation-
ships, and our previous bond example is illustrated by the third scenario
(denoted by an asterisk). The major auction was up, the news announcement
was bullish, and the market reacted by auctioning substantially higher in the
day timeframe. These circumstances indicate a market that is strong and
continuing higher.

Summary
Instead of getting emotionally and/or ﬁnancially whipped back and forth
along with the market during a major news announcement, traders can use
the news to their beneﬁt by following these steps:
1. Balance your inventory so that you hold no position going into the

scheduled announcement (except for long-term traders).

2. Make note of market expectations, recent market direction, and salient

reference points.

& Beyond the Competent Trader

Let us look back to David, the aspiring pianist, and his path to becoming an
expert musician. When he reached competency after years of learning and
practice, he had mastered the technical and mechanical aspects of playing the
piano. Yet, he had not transcended the physical notes on paper to become an
expert. Similarly, a good market understanding is only part of the equation
for achieving expert results. Many traders who develop a solid academic
background still do not make enough money to justify being in the market.
To progress beyond the average, beyond the middle of the bell curve and
into the upper extremes of excellence, you must achieve self-understanding.
To become a proﬁcient trader, it is necessary to become so intimate with the
mechanical aspects of the market that they form a holistic pattern in your
mind. Only then can you begin to understand how your own personal
strengths and weaknesses directly inﬂuence your trading performance. As
Adam Smith said in his book The Money Game, “If you don’t know who you
are, the market is an expensive place to ﬁnd out.”

We have reached the end of the Competent chapter. The study of the
basic theories behind evaluating market-generated information through the
Market Proﬁle is now complete. We have covered a tremendous amount of
information in a relatively short time. So before we move on to the next step
in the learning process, take some time to review and solidify the concepts
we have discussed. Observe the market. Test and apply your market
understanding. Build the experience that will clear the fogged corners of the
window to reveal the big picture.

Proﬁcient

277

Throughout the book, we have followed the ﬁve levels of skill acquisition

through a college student named David. After hearing a moving
rendition of Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata,” David decided he wanted
to learn to play the piano. He started the learning process by studying purely
derivative sources—taking lessons and reading books on music theory. After
becoming familiar with the basics, David began to practice while continuing
his derivative learning. In other words, the instruction and mechanical
knowledge acted as a catalyst, allowing David to actively apply and develop
the theory into actual musical ability. He was building experience.

Finally, after years of practice, lessons, and study, David transcended the
realm of derivative knowledge. He simply knew the theory and technique
backward and forward. When David sat down at the piano, the ﬁngering
had been committed to muscle memory and the notes and time signatures
were so fully assimilated in his mind that he no longer actively thought of
them while playing. David had reached the level of proﬁciency that allowed
him to express his thoughts and feelings through an instrument as though it
were an extension of his emotion.

Becoming proﬁcient in any endeavor is a highly personal process. Think
about something you excel in, something that has become an instinctive,
intuitive ability. Perhaps it is an athletic talent such as golf or tennis. Maybe
you have a knack for ﬂy-ﬁshing, sailing, or chess. Whatever it is, remember
the way you felt when you ﬁnally performed the activity perfectly.

Suppose that after years of working on your golf swing through lessons,
Arnold Palmer books, and hours at the driving range, you play the perfect
round. A proﬁcient golfer intuitively combines course conditions, wind, the
ball’s lie, stance, club selection, position, and the actual stroke to achieve the

3GC05

04/23/2013

15:23:59

Page 278

perfect shot. Imagine the exhilaration of having the ability to make such a shot
70 times in one round. A perfect round transcends all derivative learning. It is
the culmination of knowledge and experience. When all the factors come
together, the golfer can “feel” the shot. Developing and learning to recognize
that feeling of excellence is the result of a synthesis of derivative and empirical
knowledge—of academic learning and hands-on experience.

A futures trader who has progressed beyond competency also begins to
intuitively feel when conditions are right for a successful trade. Again, this
intuitive ability is fostered by more than just a sound fundamental base. Through
market experience, you will begin to recognize certain situations where all the
concepts and theories come together and you “feel” the trade. Once you have
reached this stage of market understanding, the difﬁcult part becomes learning
to trust your intuitions—to trust the feeling of opportunity. In other words, a
proﬁcient trader must begin to learn and develop self-understanding.

In the ﬁnal stages of learning, experience becomes the primary teacher,
and introspection the vehicle for excellence. In this chapter, we will
discuss the importance of self-understanding and its relation to becoming
an expert trader.

The Results Equation: Market Understanding (cid:1) (Self-Understanding þ
Strategy) ¼ Results1

The Results Equation is an oversimpliﬁed formula for achieving successful
trading returns. It is built upon three concepts: market understanding, self-
understanding, and strategy. Up to this point, we have covered the large
volume of theory that leads to a sound market understanding. In addition,
we have discussed many trading strategies based on speciﬁc structural
features, such as opening types and Special Situations. We have also
examined the strategic application of more general concepts such as other
timeframe control and trending versus bracketed markets. These structural
strategies arise from an understanding of the marketplace, but they are
useless if a trader does not have the conﬁdence to implement them.

A truly effective strategy must incorporate your strengths and weaknesses
into a comprehensive game plan that uses your abilities to their fullest
potential. The pivotal element in turning market understanding into a
practical, successful trading strategy is self-understanding. You may have
developed a thorough understanding of the marketplace and a reliable
academic trading strategy, but without an understanding of yourself, you

will not be able to effectively employ that strategy. Your trading results will
not rise above the bell curve average. And, as we have mentioned before, the
average market participant does not make money. To become proﬁcient,
you must begin the ongoing process of learning to understand yourself.

& Self-Understanding: Becoming a
Successful Trader

Most of us do a great deal of soul-searching before we choose a profession.
Whether we realize it or not, in this process we consider not only the
intellectual and academic requirements of the profession, but also how that
vocation meets our own psychological and emotional needs. What does it
take to become a surgeon, and can I deal with patients that die on the
operating table? Do I want to work for someone else, or do I want to call my
own shots? Do I want to manage people, or would I prefer to do research on
my own? Do I want a profession that is steady and predictable, or would I
prefer to have each day be entirely different?

Additionally, we also consider whether or not we possess the innate skills
that can spell the difference between success at one profession over another.
Do I have the precision hand-eye coordination to become a professional
baseball player, the mathematical mind to work as a physicist, the writing
style to become a reporter, or the mechanical aptitude to become a
mechanic or electrician? These basic skills are usually identiﬁable early
on. When choosing a profession, we need to consider whether we possess
the skills required to succeed at that profession. While there are many ways
to develop these skills through education, coaching, and experience, the
seeds must already be planted if they are to grow.

Most individuals have never given much thought to the underlying skills
necessary to become a successful trader. Consequently, when they begin to
trade they wander into a very dangerous area totally unprepared. The
personal characteristics that generally accompany success in the futures
market include maturity and stability, a strong sense of self-competitiveness
(as opposed to team-competitiveness), the inner strength to maintain
contrary opinions, an orderly mind, and the ability to make a decision
and act with conﬁdence.

The ultimate decision to become a professional futures trader involves
a melding of your personal skills with your ﬁnancial and emotional needs.
Many view futures trading as a glamorous profession in which it is

possible to make a lot of money with very little effort. Few professions
are truly glamorous, however, and to the most successful futures traders,
the greatest reward is often emotional, while the ﬁnancial reward is
regarded as secondary. If this comes as a shock to you, consider our
Olympic athletes. Although a few are compensated well through sponsor-
ships, the majority of these individuals are in the athletic profession ﬁrst
for the emotional value—for the inner feeling of accomplishment that
comes with mastering a sport, with winning the game. The ﬁnancial
rewards are secondary and ﬂow naturally as a consequence of their
success. And this, it seems, is where most futures traders err. They are
drawn to, and in a sense intoxicated by, the lure of the ﬁnancial reward,
while never giving a second thought to the emotional or intellectual
requirements of success.

Most traders, like drunk drivers, should be taken off the streets. They are
trading under the inﬂuence—under the inﬂuence of the many advertise-
ments that blanket the pages of trading magazines and newspapers with
claims and near promises of quick, easy success. Each month, a new guru is
touting a break-through system that turns a computer into a black box gold
mine. Enter the orders and scoop out your proﬁts. These glittery ads spark
interest and induce sales, but they are misleading.

In contrast, how would you respond to an advertisement that read:

Wanted: People willing to undergo specialized training in how to
succeed. This program will require rigorous intellectual schooling,
intensive introspection geared toward identifying invisible blocks to
success that are trapped within you, and then a long behavior-
modiﬁcation process necessary to overcome these inner obstacles.
At the same time, you will undergo a daily on-the-job training
program. Requirements for this training program are as follows:
intellectual ability, a meaningful amount of capital, and the willingness
to immerse your entire self-esteem into the program. It is anticipated
that you will lose most, if not all, of your capital and will be forced to
rationalize the whole experience to maintain your self-esteem.
Although it takes a minimum of two years to reach a moderate level
of success, soon after this initial training program the majority of you
will drop out because it is too hard, takes too much time, requires too
much ﬂexibility, is not well deﬁned, and there are not enough concrete
rules. Of the few that remain, less than 10 percent of you will enjoy
the feeling of exhilaration that goes with completing what you set out

to accomplish. Like the artist who only gets better, your newly
acquired skill and experience will be just the start of a process that can
continue for a lifetime. You will be equipped to succeed at your
profession. You will be an entrepreneur.

This imaginary advertisement could apply to virtually any serious
professional venture. It is not meant to convince you not to trade. Rather,
it is meant to dispel the glamorous illusions that surround the ﬁeld of futures
trading. You have already experienced the difﬁculty of learning the vast
amount of theory that makes up market understanding. Developing self-
understanding is just as difﬁcult—perhaps more so, for self-understanding
cannot be learned from a derivative source.

& Self-Observation

The Proﬁle graphic enables a trader to objectively organize and observe the
market’s behavior, which leads to the development of market under-
standing. Similarly,
to developing self-
self-observation is essential
understanding. One of the most effective methods to observe and reﬂect
on your actions is to keep a trading journal.

For a trading journal to be useful, you must be honest and consistent,
writing down thoughts, feelings, and surrounding circumstances before,
during, and after each trade. Observing how your emotions affect the
outcome of each trade can reveal your propensity for risk, your intuitive
skills, the affects of outside circumstances, and myriad other factors that
contribute to self-understanding.

Eventually, you will begin to identify behavioral patterns and the types
of events that directly affect your trading performance. Perhaps you are
overly affected by conﬂicting news sources and professional opinions.
Maybe you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to trade against the crowd and are easily
shaken from your convictions by contrary opinion. For example, you may
notice that every time you make a trade based on a fundamental source,
you exit too early and have little conﬁdence in the trade. If this is the
case, it may be best to simply not expose yourself to outside opinion. Or,
perhaps you want to be a long-term trader, but ﬁnd you have trouble
sleeping during nights when you are carrying outstanding positions. By
keeping a trading journal, you can begin to understand how you affect
your trading results.

& The Whole-Brained Trader

Although we still know relatively little about the vast capabilities of the
human brain, research has revealed that the brain is divided into two
separate hemispheres, each having very different functions. Bennett W.
Goodspeed describes these differences in The Tao Jones Averages:

. . . our left hemisphere, which controls the right side of the body, is
analytically oriented. It reasons logically and sequentially and is
responsible for our speech. It is adept at math, accounting, languages,
science and writing. Like a computer, it is programmable and is
nurtured by our highly analytic educational process. The properties of
the left brain are not unique; man has developed computers that can
duplicate those functions.

Our right-brain hemisphere, which controls the movements of the
left side of the body, is unique. It operates non-sequentially, is intuitive,
artistic, has feelings, is gestalt-oriented (sees the forest and not just the
trees), and controls our visual perceptions. Since it is nonverbal, it
communicates to us through dreams and ‘gut reactions.’ The right
hemisphere provides and stores all of our nonverbal experience—a vast
amount of input, certainly much more than we can verbally retrieve.2

The difference between right- and left-brain function explains a great deal
about the diversity of interest and talent in the human species. Every
individual has a different right/left brain balance, resulting in a vast array of
mental and physical abilities. Someone who is very left-brain oriented might
become an excellent scientist or administrator, whereas a right-brained
person would more likely become an artist or playwright.

The division of right- and left-brain thinking is readily apparent in the
futures market as well. The technicians who analyze historical data, economic
ﬁgures, charts, and other technical
information are primarily left-brain
oriented. Conversely, ﬂoor traders who rely on instinct are acting according
to right-brain intuition, or gut feelings. Unfortunately, attempting to trade
with only the left or right hemisphere will result in an imbalance and poor
results. The most successful traders are able to achieve a balance between the
analytic left brain and the holistic right brain—they are whole-brained traders.

The Left Hemisphere

The left hemisphere is highly attuned to time, rules, and facts. It has been
shown that this half of the brain, while very precise, is capable of processing
only small amounts of information at a time. Therefore, attempting to trade
with only the left, factual portion of the brain is very limiting—it incorporates
only one viewpoint. Yet, there are times, such as in preparation and planning
for the day, when it is necessary to be very exact and calculating. To grasp the
facts, you must often consider them very rationally and individually. Still, the
left hemisphere is seldom able to successfully coordinate the vast amounts of
conﬂicting information disseminated by the market each day.

Imagine yourself sitting in front of your quote monitor, observing a
trading day when the markets seem to have gone haywire. You murmur in a
barely audible voice, “I cannot believe what is happening in the market
today.” Your left brain is whispering to you. The analytic decisions you made
based on rationally processed facts have not been conﬁrmed by the market.
By immersing yourself in technical indicators and scientiﬁc study, the real,
evolving nature of the marketplace slipped right past you.

The Right Hemisphere

The left brain stores knowledge. However, only through ﬁne-tuned
interaction with the intuitive right hemisphere can you successfully synthe-
size that knowledge and develop understanding. The right hemisphere is
generally known as the creative, emotional half of the brain. It is dominated
by free association and holistic processing of mass amounts of information.
A trade based on pure emotion may have an even lesser chance of success
than a trade based on calmly calculated fact. Nonetheless, once the market
opens, it is impossible to analyze the vast numbers of interacting elements
that are combined, absorbed, and reﬂected by the market at any point in
time. It takes a careful balance of academic knowledge and intuition based on
a larger understanding to trade successfully.

Combining the Two Hemispheres

It is possible to mentally change gears in order to use both hemispheres of
the brain. Each has its clear advantages and powers. After the market’s close,
for instance, the analysis of the day’s activity and preparation for the
following trading session are best accomplished by using predominantly left,
analytical talents. On the other hand, when the market is in full gear, the

fast-processing, free-associating right brain should have more control.
Ideally, we should strive to operate in a more central hemisphere, freely
calling on both sides of the brain to contribute when needed.

Neither [hemisphere] should be blindly followed, as to do so would be
to act in a half-brained way. Nor should we ignore either, for each
effectively represents half of our brain. By understanding both and
being able to use the correct hemisphere for the correct task, we can be
more whole brained and effective in our decision-making.3

Recall our discussion of Bears’ linebacker Mike Singletary in Section I of
Chapter 4. Between games, Singletary used his analytical left-brain skills to
design a game plan and thoroughly understand the opposing team’s offense.
When the game started, however, he did not have time to actively process
the overwhelming amount of incoming stimuli. He then operated in a right-
brain dominated mode, relying on intuition and holistic pattern recognition
to guide his actions.

Experts in any ﬁeld, like Mike Singletary, make whole-brained balance
appear easy. This misconception is apparent to any trader who has had a gut
feeling about a trade or an opinion based on careful analysis, only to see the
market move in the opposite direction. Like any worthwhile endeavor,
whole-brained trading takes time, patience, and experience to master.

You may come to realize that you are a predominantly right-brained or
left-brained person. This is the ﬁrst step in achieving balance. By knowing
your left/right brain strengths and weaknesses, you can begin to develop a
trading strategy that best uses your individual talents.

& Strategy

As we near the end of Proﬁcient, we look at the role and importance of
strategy. Throughout the book, we have discussed many trading strategies
based on market structure. However, there is a difference between a
complete strategy and just managing a trade. Individual trades are guided
by a set of rules based on market understanding. A complete trading strategy,
on the other hand, is more of a holistic game plan, built upon an infrastructure
of market understanding, self-understanding, and structural guidelines.

Every trader has a different timeframe, different goals, and different
needs and emotions. Consequently, developing a strategy is a unique,
individual process in which we each mold our strategy to best use our
strengths and support our weaknesses. In this discussion, then, we focus on
the business aspects of strategy, purposely avoiding the more personal
elements of self-understanding.

A Business Strategy

There are many facets to running a business. You must ﬁrst consider the
tangibles, such as capital, risk, cash ﬂow, taxes, and other general expenses.
Then, there is the upkeep and use of informational sources, basic record
keeping, and performance evaluation/measurement. Of equal importance
are the intangibles, such as knowing your competition and the role of
time—both in managing your own time and introducing a new product.
Also within this category are qualities like dedication, daily execution, and
overall strategic planning that are ultimately the driving force behind any
successful business.

Trading is a business. It involves the same tangible and intangible elements
of any business strategy. We will examine many of these crucial areas, ﬁrst
from a general business perspective, and then within the context of how
together they form a strategic trading plan.

Capital When running a business, two golden rules apply to capital: (1)
make sure that you are adequately capitalized to begin with; and (2) conserve
it. A business that is undercapitalized is handicapped from the start. A new
venture must be able to absorb unexpected start-up costs, as well as fund
projects that may be important to long-term survival.

There are obvious costs to trading, particularly when one is just starting
out. It is critical that traders are adequately capitalized for their style of
trading. For example, day traders generally do not need to be as highly
capitalized as long-term traders who hold positions overnight. However,
even a day trader needs enough capital to take advantage of a market-created
opportunity to “take a trade home” with minimal risk, such as that which is
often provided by a 3 to I day.
Undercapitalization leads

to “tick-watching.” Traders who must
constantly worry about taking a loss are less likely to be objective in
their interpretation of the market and, therefore, how they manage
their positions.

Location Locating a business is similar to locating a trade. Where would
you prefer to build a gas station, on a four-way corner just off the interstate,
or somewhere between two trafﬁc lights on a road divided by a median strip?
Trades, too, are located based on cost/revenue considerations. Where
would you prefer to buy for a long-term trade, near the long-term lows with
strong apparent excess to lean on or somewhere in the middle of the long-
term range? A poorly located trade suggests that you are assuming greater
risk for less than optimal reward.

How do you achieve optimal trade location? Planning. Do your home-
work, identify regions of potential good trade location afforded by excess,
balance areas, and brackets, and then put your orders in ahead of time.
When you are in the thick of the trading day, the best trade location often
looks like the worst at the moment it is reached. (Remember, the best
trades generally ﬂy in the face of the most recent activity). It becomes
extremely difﬁcult to pull the trigger—to make the trade. That little
subjective voice begins to cloud your rational decision-making ability to the
point that you just sit there frozen, watching a good opportunity slip away.
Many times ideal trade location seems too far away for the market to
move in one day. Put the order in anyway. The anxiety that often accompanies
such dynamic moves can keep you from entering the trade unless the order is
already in the pit. In addition, if the trade location is truly ideal, then those
prices will not be offered long enough to enter a position unless you have
already placed your order. Just as a good chess player always plays several
moves ahead of his opponent, playing ahead of the market is what secures
good trade location.

Timing Negotiating skills are an important part of business, and patience is
crucial to successful negotiation. For example, now and then every business
has to deal with its suppliers. Would you rather negotiate when the product
is plentiful or scarce? The timing of your negotiations often has a direct
impact on the price you will pay.

Timing a trade is just as important as timing in a negotiation. Like the
business that waits until its supplier has excess, traders should patiently
wait for the market to demonstrate excess before they act. Many traders
had strong bearish opinions prior to the stock market crash in October
1987. However, those who sold too early were forced out of the market
(for ﬁnancial reasons) long before the global selling began. Traders who
are consistently too early need to be more patient in their negotiations
with the market.

Information Every business decision and every trading decision is based on
facts gleaned from market information. The car dealer only restocks his
inventory if his information sources suggest that he will be able to sell the
new cars. His information tells him the size of the market, the willingness of
the consumer to buy, how many cars he should purchase from the
manufacturer, and what he should charge for his stock. These same decisions
must be made in any market.

Information inﬂuences virtually every aspect of a business strategy. In a
sense, your information sources are your eyes in the market. That is why it is
essential to trade based on reliable, objective information. Many traders
surround themselves with so many opinionated and conﬂicting sources that
their decision-making abilities are paralyzed. Think back to Jim Kelvin, the
currency trader introduced at the beginning of the book. He knew that the
yen was weak, based on purely objective market-generated information.
Unfortunately, he also considered several other conﬂicting technical and
fundamental sources that made him doubt his intuitive ability.

If conﬂicting sources are hindering your trade, eliminate them. Good
businesspersons will narrow their information down, select the most reliable
sources, and get rid of the rest. Streamlining your information helps you
arrive at decisions faster and earlier.

Historically, the best and most proﬁtable businesses have entered their
respective markets before all the information was available. They saw an
opportunity and acted on it before it became obvious and the whole world
jumped in. A successful trader does not wait until structure has provided 100
percent conﬁrmation. Identify the opportunity and then do the trade.

Know Your Competition Perceptive businesses understand their competi-
tion and the kinds of responses to expect from them and devise their strategy
accordingly. What will the other players do if price drops too low or rises
too high? General Motors has a pretty good idea what the Japanese
carmakers will do given any number of price-related decisions. Such
knowledge of participant behavior is applicable to trading as well. Successful
traders have a good inclination of how other market participants will react to
a given change in price.

From a trading standpoint, one part of knowing your competition should
involve making a continual assessment of whether the other market
participants (your competition) are too long or too short. For example,
if a market that had been in a sustained up auction suddenly breaks in the day
timeframe and stalls, creating a b formation, participants were probably

Page 288

too long. Through an understanding of the competition, you know that the
activity was most likely a long liquidation break, and the buying auction will
continue. Every successful businessperson and every successful trader understands the
behavior of the other participants.

In addition to knowing your competition, you must know
Know Yourself
yourself. What is it you do best? Under what conditions do you ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to be objective? There are many examples of businesses that have
grown very successful by identifying and concentrating on their speciﬁc
strengths, such as Midas Mufﬂers and McDonald’s hamburgers. Learning to
recognize, accept, and work with your strengths and weaknesses is perhaps
the most difﬁcult aspect of becoming an expert trader.

Earlier in Proﬁcient, we discussed the You portion of trading at length.
However, a derivative source can only offer suggestions and provide ideas
for growth. Self-understanding must be developed through continual self-
observation and introspection. Keep a trading journal. Find patterns of
thought and circumstance that lead to successful trades and actively
incorporate those patterns into your trading strategy. Eliminate negative
inﬂuences that cause bad trades and promote irrational thought. Self-
understanding is an ongoing process essential to an effective overall strategy.

Consistent, Daily Execution A healthy business turns out revenues day
after day. The old adage “Successful trading is a lot of small losses and a few
big winners” is simply not true. It still may be that the really big proﬁts are
made on a few trades, but the ﬁrst goal is to see that the overhead is covered
on a daily basis. A lot of small losses actually contribute to the overhead. A
proﬁcient trader will generate revenues virtually every day.

Consistency breeds objectivity. Consistency produces cash ﬂow and takes care
of current expenses, such as (in trading) ofﬁce space, quote equipment,
medical insurance, and so on. Consistency also eases tensions, so that the
business can operate from a clear state of mind, look ahead, and plan
expansion.

Inventory Both in a general business and trading, inventory management
often spells the difference between success and failure. The goal, of course,
is to buy at the most advantageous price. And, like investing in real estate,
that generally means that you have to buy inventory when no one else wants it, or
else you do not get the ideal price. Similarly, a trader will seek to initiate
larger positions when the market appears to be near its long-term highs or

Page 289

lows. Price generally reaches a long-term high when the entire market is
buying, and therefore when it is least popular to sell. Conversely, price
reaches a long-term low when the entire market is selling and it is least
popular to buy.

Keep in mind, however, that many traders lose a lot of money attempting
to pick market tops and bottoms. Be alert to conditions that create market
extremes and place your positions just after the high or low has been
conﬁrmed.

The handling of inventory varies from business to business, just as traders
handle their positions differently. For example, locals handle their inventory
much like football ticket scalpers outside the stadium or the grocer in your
local supermarket—high volume, low mark-up—the less time spent on the
shelves the better. Long-term traders, however, probably handle their
positions with greater patience, much like a jeweler and his diamonds.

There are costs associated with not having enough inventory as well as
costs of having too much. If you have no inventory (no positions), your
opportunity for revenue declines. On the other hand, if you carry too much
inventory, you may not have enough capital or space to take advantage of
new opportunities. In addition, as one’s inventory grows older, it may lose
or gain value depending on changing market conditions. The overriding
difference between most businesses and trading, however, is that the futures
market controls the price of your inventory. You have less control over risk
and opportunity and, therefore, must pay much closer attention to your
inventory and changing market conditions.

Risk Every good businessperson keeps a watchful eye on risk. This means
dedicating the majority of one’s time and capital to playing the short odds
rather than the long odds, for the main objective is to stay in business. This
concept is well illustrated by a theme common among sales organizations.
Generally, the salespersons who continually seek the big deals, hoping to hit
the grand pay-off, invariably go broke. On the other hand, the individuals
who succeed are those who work on ﬁve or six big deals, while spending the
majority of their time on the 70 or 80 small accounts that provide consistent
revenue. If a decision is made to go after a big deal, it is generally only with a
portion of the capital or resources of the business.

As an example of how one might incorporate this concept into one’s
trading strategy, consider the regulation of maximum trades (large, long-
term positions). Suppose that part of your strategy is to trade up to three
futures at one time. If so, then perhaps you limit yourself to just one

maximum trade at a time. This way, you do not risk all of your trading
capital on big deals (this is just an example, not a speciﬁc recommendation).
Similarly, if your capitalization is lower, or if you want to reduce the anxiety
that often accompanies maximum trades, perhaps you elect to participate in
a maximum trade using option spreads.

Trading requires continual risk evaluation. Like a credit policy at a bank
where overnight, intermediate and long-term spending limits are calculated
precisely through conscious decisions, with each new trade one must
evaluate the accompanying risk.

Goals There are short-term goals as well as long-term goals. Good
businesspeople realize that long-term goals are achieved as a result of
the constant, cumulative meeting of short-term goals. Write down your goals.
Make them clear and concise and strive to achieve them through realistic
shorter-term checkpoints. From time to time, review them and make sure
they still represent your current wants and needs.

Record Keeping and Performance All businesses keep records for
reasons more than satisfying the IRS. Records help a business remain
objective and realistic when evaluating performance. How productive is
your sales force? How well is the market responding to your advertising and
marketing? Is your overall strategy producing the hoped-for results? What
is the bottom line?

Record keeping is equally important to trading. Records give you an
objective way to evaluate how your trading strategy is faring and whether it
is in need of change. Proper record management should tell you more than if
you are making money. It should reveal where your trading revenues are
coming from, what market conditions and trading techniques are most
proﬁtable, whether you are meeting daily expenses, and so on. The better
your records, the easier it is to isolate the problem areas, ﬁnd solutions, and
hone in on what you do best.

Dedication Dedication is one of the intangibles, unique to each individual
and therefore not easily measured or valued. Dedication is doing
your homework every day. It is keeping up your charts, getting up
that extra hour early to get a head start on the markets, and putting in
that extra hour afterward.

Dedication is not just time and work; it is the heartbeat of a business. It is
that personal element, the desire for personal achievement possessed by a

handful of individuals. It is the driving force behind any successful business.
Just wanting to be successful is not enough; you have to make it happen. True
dedication involves paying a price . . . and there is a price.

Applications When dealing in the minute-to-minute or day-to-day spe-
ciﬁcs of trading, it is sometimes difﬁcult to appreciate the importance of
strategy. Many traders have spent thousands of dollars learning the market
and developing rules and guidelines for their trading. These aids come in
multiple forms, from the Market Proﬁle to rigidly disciplined trading
models. Unfortunately, much of this knowledge and money is wasted,
unless it is also woven together with a comprehensive strategy that takes into
account those attributes that are important to staying in business as a trader.
In summary, we offer three very general steps to getting started in
developing your trading business.

Step 1: Accept and begin to view trading as a business.

Step 2: Develop a comprehensive strategy based on the concepts of
successful business management. To restate, every business—
and trading is no exception—needs a healthy interaction of the
following areas if it is to survive.
– Capital
– Timing
– Location
– Knowing Your Competition
– Knowing Yourself
– Consistency
This very ideal listing, collectively considered, forms the strate-

gic shell of trading survival.

Step 3: Formulate speciﬁc rules and mini-strategies that will help guide and
mold your individual trades in order to meet the long-term goals of
your trading strategy. Unfortunately, we as humans cannot function
purely on a strategic level. We have to deal with facts, disappoint-
ments in our own shortcomings, capital requirements, the day-to-
day details of physically and mentally entering and exiting trades,
and so forth. Thus, once these long-term goals have been laid out,
we can begin to outline a series of short-term goals and trading
disciplines to help us fulﬁll our long-term strategy.

FIGURE 5.1 Trading Strategy Flow Chart

Figure 5.1 illustrates, in a very general sense, how one trader might design
the underpinnings of a business trading strategy. This ﬁgure represents a basic
set of guidelines that begin to tie the strategy together. Once these basic
requirements are established, one must then ﬁne tune them with yet additional
rules, so that eventually a daily, trade-by-trade application can be reached.

The poor performance by most professional Wall Street investors is
the result of an imbalance . . . a lack of whole-brainedness.

Bennett W. Goodspeed, The Tao Jones Averages

Most traders eventually become competent, but few transcend the rules
and theories to reach proﬁciency. To progress beyond the average, traders
must learn to understand themselves—how their personal strengths,

weaknesses, and individual personalities affect their trading results. On the
other hand, some traders have a good self-understanding but view their
trading as a part-time endeavor or hobby. Trading is a business, and to
become proﬁcient a trader must develop a business strategy.

Successful futures trading is the result of a delicate balance between
derivative learning and experience, between analytical thinking and intui-
tion. A proﬁcient trader forms a trading strategy built upon an infrastructure
of market understanding, self-understanding, and structural guidelines. He
begins to intuitively feel when conditions are right for a successful trade,
balancing left-brain discipline with right-brain creativity. Strive to achieve
balance—to become a whole-brained trader.

The Expert
Trader

295

The knowledge that is gained from books and experience is an integral

part of becoming a successful trader, but the path to expert trading
begins within yourself. You must believe that you can reach your goals,
fulﬁll your aspirations. Mastering the academics is not enough. An athlete
with average ability will be victorious over opponents of greater skill if he
believes he can be a champion.

Achieving the level of expert in any pursuit is a challenge that few people
attempt, for it requires complete dedication and determination. To reach
and maintain excellence, an individual must have a desire to succeed that
transcends personal sacriﬁce. Understandably, most people are not willing
to give up the diversity of their lives for a single all-encompassing goal.
Consider anyone that you perceive to be an expert in his or her ﬁeld.
Olympic swimmers spend from four to six hours in the water every day.
Great composers and musicians have been known to practice for most of
their waking hours. Top salespersons work 12- to 16-hour days. The best
creative advertising personnel are always rethinking their accounts, shaping
and detailing new ideas. Any highly successful business exceeds the norm by
going beyond the rules and calculative rationality to the higher grounds of
innovation and excellence.

Do you have what it takes to become an expert trader? We have covered a
tremendous wealth of material, from the market’s smallest unit to the
importance of self-understanding—but the knowledge contained in this
book is only the beginning. A derivative source can impart all the learning in

3GC06

Page 296

the world, but again, much learning does not teach understanding. Benjamin
Hoff put it wonderfully simply in The Tao of Pooh: “Knowledge and
Experience do not necessarily speak the same language . . . there is
more to Knowing than just being correct.”1

In your pursuit of excellence, you may sometimes stumble and feel the
frustration of your mistakes. The challenge before you is not without
difﬁculties, but with the inner strength that grows from believing in your
potential, you can strive to soar beyond the average—feel the exhilaration
that goes with completing what you set out to accomplish. As you continue
to learn and build experience, remember that your newly acquired skill and
understanding is just the start of a process that will continue for a lifetime.

Experience

One  of  the  most  astute  Amazon.com  reviews  for  this  book  was  not

intended as a compliment—the reviewer said Mind Over Markets was
“too complicated.” Those two words capture the reason why most traders
fail, as well as the reason why the book in your hands is still relevant,
challenging, and insightful after two decades: It was written for serious
traders, and it doesn’t purport to be a total solution.

Mind Over Markets is a practical handbook for developing an understanding
of market behavior that will help you trade with the odds in your favor. And
in the 22 years since it was published (and translated into Chinese and
French) the authors have continued on their journeys, delving deeper into
practical experience. And so it is experience that this ﬁnal, fresh chapter is all
about; we’ll bring the book learning in the preceding chapters into the light
of real experience, where real money is won and lost in the market’s endless
heaving to and fro. The examples we’ll employ are simply meant to provide
context for the content—the synthesis of the ﬁve stages of learning can only
happen in practice.

& Set Aside Your Expectations

Traders, being human, want markets to be orderly and easily understand-
able. But if you start with that expectation then you’re off on the wrong
foot. We’re all prone to seeking only what we’re looking for, which keeps
us from being present for what is actually happening.

Being free from all distractions, he can undertake his practice
wholeheartedly. Practice combined with non-attachment helps him
to continue his search until he reaches the goal.

—Swami Rama

To be successful, you must set aside your desires and expectations.
You’ve got to get inside the head of the people you’re competing against.
How gruesome does it feel to get caught short? How would that feeling
manifest itself in a herd of day traders? So much of trading today is about
momentum, which can offer invaluable insight when considered in the
proper context.

After you understand how markets operate—not as orderly and
scientiﬁc as you’d like—then you’ve got to ﬁgure out how your own
head operates. You can have all the market knowledge in the world, but
if you don’t understand the ways in which rationalization can be
a powerful gravitational
then market knowledge might not
help you.

Trading is a game. And if you can ﬁgure out what’s going on in your head,

force,

and in the heads of your competitors, you’re more likely to win.

& Mind Over Markets in Proﬁle

In 2007, 15 years following the publication of our original work, we
published Markets in Proﬁle: Proﬁting from the Auction Process, which examines
the market’s continuous two-way auction process by taking a profoundly
different approach toward sorting and understanding the differences in
behavior between the various timeframes:
& Day

& Short-term

& Intermediate-term

& Long-term

Seemingly knowledgeable experts routinely maintain that there is a
buyer for every seller, and a seller for every buyer. This simple utterance
sets up a mental block that impedes a real understanding of the auction
process; actionable reality begins with understanding the relationships and
behavioral expectations among the timeframes. While it is true that there is

3GC07

05/14/2013

10:1:16

Page 299

a buyer for every seller, the buyers and sellers are not evenly matched—
they are operating in different timeframes, which means their actions
have different weight.

It is imbalance between the timeframes that drives the auction process.
The longest timeframe, for example, most commonly transacts with the
day, or short-term timeframes, that are considered to be “weaker hands” and
less committed to holding inventory. When this occurs, the inventory for
the shorter timeframes often gets out of balance, which leads to short-
covering rallies or long-liquidation breaks. This is the ebb and ﬂow of the
market’s tides.

Markets in Proﬁle offers a deeper dive into the behavior of each of the
separate timeframes. The book revolves around a central idea: Information
has no impact until individuals act on that information. There are as many
responses to any given piece of information as there are humans who receive
it; we all ﬁnd ourselves somewhere on the long continuum between leader
and follower, in every endeavor.

To illustrate the importance of this concept, consider what would
happen if you were to simultaneously share a perfect investment idea with
ﬁve different people. One of those ﬁve might act immediately, without
requiring further evidence, while each of the remaining four would act in
successively later time periods, waiting to see proof that the idea was, in
fact, generating proﬁts. The Diffusion Model, made popular by Malcolm
Gladwell in The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference
(Boston: Little, Brown, 2000), would label each of these individuals, in
succession, as:
& Innovators

& Early adopters

& Early majority

& Late majority

& Laggards

These ﬁve archetypes can help us better understand the way various
timeframes’ interactions inﬂuence the market’s auction process. Once the
laggards have transacted, for example, the market is generally prepared to
begin to auction in the opposite direction. If a market has been rising, the top
of the rally may be drawing in new laggard longs, as well as laggard shorts
that are ﬁnally covering.

& Market-Understanding and
Self-Understanding

Many successful traders we’ve worked with over the years have expressed
a common opinion: Once they’ve gained market understanding, at least
75 percent of their results are based upon self-understanding. But attemp-
ting to advance your self-understanding is difﬁcult, in this context, until
you have a solid grasp of market fundamentals; if you’re not looking at the
correct information to begin with, then market understanding may never
arrive. Our goal has been to provide you with a realistic framework for
understanding how markets function. The essential component of that
framework is the continuous two-way auction process, captured and
recorded with the Market Proﬁle.

Perfect Practice Makes Perfect

Reading Markets in Proﬁle, the follow-up to Mind Over Markets, is the next
step on the path to becoming an expert trader. In it, you will learn to
formulate a contextual understanding of the market; real learning always
begins with appreciating the importance of context. At the highest level of
skill acquisition, time spent studying, interpreting, and trading the market
is the most important factor that separates the winners and losers—like in
any endeavor. But note that the efﬁcacy of the practice is entirely
dependent on the practice being correct. You can practice a bad golf
swing all day, but that dimpled white ball will never obey until you
practice a correct swing. All day.

The more advanced your trading, the more nuanced your education becomes.

Blinded by Price

You will recall that price is simply a mechanism for advertising opportunity,
with time regulating all opportunities, and volume serving to validate the
success or failure of the advertised opportunities. Most traders (as well as
most academics) begin by incorrectly responding to the single dimension of
price. What is far more important is what lies behind the response to that
price. You must continuously ask yourself the right questions. For example:
& Which timeframe(s) responded to price?

& How strong was the response, as represented by volume?

or laggards?

& Were the innovators responding opportunistically to the actions of the

late majority and laggards?

In The Invisible Gorilla by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, the
audience is invited to view a ﬁlm that features two teams passing
basketballs back and forth in a complicated pattern. One team is dressed
in white shirts, while the other is wearing black. The audience is asked to
count the passes made by the white-shirted team, while ignoring the black-
shirted team. Here’s the amazing part: Half-way through the ﬁlm, a woman
wearing a gorilla costume appears, ambles onto the court, thumps her
chest, then walks off the court. The gorilla is in view for nine full seconds,
but approximately half of all viewers didn’t even notice the gorilla. And
not only did half the audience miss the gorilla, but they couldn’t believe a
gorilla was really there!

Traders who are focused solely on price miss most of the salient
information embedded within the market’s two-way auctions. These
same traders often wonder, after the market has closed, how they could
have missed some of the market’s most obvious opportunities. Many
resolve to step back and take a more comprehensive view of the
market, focusing on those elements that are far more important than
price. The difﬁculty is that
leaning on price has become such an
automatic response that it is difﬁcult to broaden your focus and execute
new resolve.

But there’s a course of action that will help you overcome that automatic,

knee-jerk response to price—preparation.

Be Prepared

How do you prepare to overcome the inexorable forces of will, memory,
and desire? You start by developing a tactical plan—a game plan that lays
out tactical choices, based on potential outcomes. The execution of a
tactical plan of course requires that you remain very much aware of the
current price action, but the goal is to be prepared to make a tactical choice,
avoiding price blindness.

My personal preparation begins by getting as far away from daily
price as possible—I begin by reviewing a monthly bar chart, like the one
in Figure 7.1.

FIGURE 7.1

S&P Indices Monthly Bar Taken December 2012

Perspective

The monthly bar shows that the S&P indices are just below the multiyear high
set in September 2012. Additionally, an excess low was established in
November. The two most important concepts we deal with are excess and
balance. Excess marks the end of one auction and the beginning of a new
auction. When a market comes out of balance, it also represents the beginning
of a new auction. Notice that the excess on the September high is far less than
the excess on the November low. The long-term trend remains up.

Next, I review the weekly bar. If change is to occur, it will manifest itself
through the weekly bar prior to becoming evident through the monthly bar.
Then I review the daily bar. Similarly, the daily bar will indicate change prior
to the weekly bar. Bar charts are employed to speed-read the market.
Finally, I review the Proﬁles for greater detail.
Let’s take a closer look at Figure 7.2.
The weekly bar shows an excess low followed by four weeks of one-
timeframing higher (one-timeframing higher occurs when the low of the
next week does not exceed [take out] the low of the preceding week).

The latest weekly settlement is close to the low for the week. Close your
eyes and imagine what the weekly bar will look like if, during the early part
of the next week, the prior week’s low is taken out. The market will have
stopped one-timeframing higher, and an excess high will be conﬁrmed. The
cessation of a one-timeframing mode represents change, and trading is all
about understanding and anticipating change.

3GC07

FIGURE 7.2

S&P Weekly Bar

Now imagine what the weekly bar might look like if the one-timeframing
mode remains in place (Figure 7.3). If you haven’t imagined the two
scenarios described above, early price movement during the following week
will be more difﬁcult to keep in perspective. Additionally, focusing on the
importance of weekly one-timeframing will reduce the odds of price
blindness.

The daily bar shows an excess high, similar to the excess high shown on
the weekly bar. Next, focus on the downward one-timeframing mode.

Page 304

This contrasts with the upward one-timeframing mode shown under the
weekly bar—change is very likely to occur early in the week.

Trading is about dealing with change. People generally don’t like change, but

change is at the heart of opportunity, in any endeavor.

The upward one-timeframing mode shown on the weekly bar versus the
downward one-timeframing mode displayed on the daily bar presents an
ambiguous picture. And as much as people tend to dislike change, they abhor
ambiguity. But again, real trading opportunities develop from ambiguous
situations (if the situation weren’t ambiguous, everyone would be sharing
the same position).

The daily Proﬁle from December 14, 2012, depicts an almost perfectly
balanced day; the Point Of Control (POC) is just a single tick above the
center of the range (Figure 7.4). Think of the POC as the fairest price at
which business is being conducted in the day timeframe. This conceptual
approach makes it easier to understand what is actually occurring in the
market. In this case, the question is this: Are traders selling S&P futures at
prices below the fairest price and becoming short-in-the-hole? Or are they
buying futures above the fairest price?

As I ﬁnish my analysis for the following week, my expectation is for a
balanced Monday opening. Any meaningful change to the weekly bar will
occur outside of Friday’s daily balanced range. Reﬂect back on the weekly
bar, which settled at a level where the market could continue to one-
timeframe higher—this would represent the status quo—or cease one-
timeframing higher, which would represent change.

There are three likely scenarios when trading a balanced market:

1. Remain within balance.
2. Look above or below the balance and fail to show continuation—we
refer to this as a breakout failure. When the breakout fails in one direction,
it is common to see the market trade toward the opposite extreme of the
identiﬁed balanced range.

3. Look above or below the balance and accelerate, which completes the

breakout. These are what we refer to as go with opportunities.
Your mental ﬂexibility will be exponentially increased if you are always
prepared for at least these three possible scenarios. The action may be the result
of an unexpected short-covering rally or long-liquidation break, an exogenous
event, out-of-range earnings, an economic announcement, or larger time-
frames entering the market. If you have already considered different scenarios,
you will be better prepared to quickly adapt to any directional auction.

Overnight Inventory
The ﬁnal preparatory step, which is completed just prior to the pit session
opening, is to evaluate overnight trading and inventory. This is why we split
out our Proﬁles between pit session and overnight trade. You will only gain
conﬁdence in employing this analysis through your own observation;
misunderstanding overnight inventory or disregarding it is another example
of price blindness.

Determining if overnight inventory is long or short is simply mechanical.
We measure overnight inventory from the prior pit session close or settle,
and if the majority of overnight trade is above this level, we consider
overnight inventory to be long. Similarly, if the majority of overnight trade
occurs below the prior pit session settle, we deem overnight inventory as
short. If overnight trade occurs about equally on both sides of the prior pit
session settle, then we determine that overnight inventory is neutral.

The following example—selected to explain the concept—is not all

that unusual.

The volume that occurs overnight is often no more than 25 percent of the
volume experienced during the pit session hours. Generally, overnight trade
involves shorter timeframe, weaker-hands traders. If inventory gets too long or
too short, the odds are good that there will be an inventory adjustment shortly
after the pit session opening. On occasion, the inventory adjustment can occur
later in the session, depending on the conﬁdence level in the current pit session.

The opening on December 3, 2012, occurs near the high of the overnight
trade, and begins to sell off
immediately; long-overnight inventory is
immediately liquidated to bring the market into balance. Understanding
the behavior of shorter timeframe traders and their tendency to fall prey to
price blindness is pivotal in appreciating the inﬂuence of overnight trade.
Clearly it isn’t as simple as conveyed in this example. However, your ﬁnal
morning analysis should assess overnight inventory, and alert you to the
potential adjustment of that inventory (Figure 7.5).

If overnight inventory is long, for example, and the market doesn’t
adjust, that is an indication of a strong market—at least in the short term.
Quite often you’ll see an early adjustment when there is a signiﬁcant
degree of long or short overnight inventory. Not being aware of a potential
adjustment, or seeing the adjustment as more than it actually is, can mislead
you for the entire session. This is a difﬁcult concept for inexperienced
traders to grasp. The best way to begin to internalize overnight trading is to
monitor each day, always forming your own opinion—as we’ve said a
hundred times, self-conﬁdence and market-understanding can only be
gained through your own experience. The concepts addressed here are
meant to provide contextual awareness, which is the ultimate starting point
for self-development.

Traders who don’t prepare, or don’t know how to prepare, are
generally at a serious disadvantage. Being prepared includes writing
down at least three possible market scenarios: What will I do if the
auction moves up, down, or remains in balance? How will I assess the
conviction of those moves?

Gaps Can Be Gold

Leading up to November 23, 2012, the ﬁnancial news stations interviewed
a number of traders and analysts who were bullish on gold based on
price—price had been rising. Let’s look at the daily bar in Figure 7.6.

Earlier we stated that the two most important concepts we deal with are
excess and balance. Please note that a gap is a form of excess—view a gap as
a series of invisible single prints. The November 23, 2012, high at 1754.7
did not ﬁll the gap that extended up to 1761.3; long-term sellers remained in
control. Once again, the importance of understanding timeframes and their
attendant behaviors is vital. As short-term traders were covering shorts,
short-term momentum traders began to pile on to the auction. Selling to
these buy orders were long-term, opportunistic traders who were selling at
the top of the trading range, which was deﬁned by the very visual gap. As
you can see from this example, there was a “seller for every buyer.”
However, the different timeframe participation reveals that the process
cannot be explained so simplistically.

An inside day followed the failed attempt to ﬁll the gap. An inside day is
one form of balance. Within a couple of days, our two most important
references—excess and balance, not price—have garnered our full attention.
Earlier we outlined the three scenarios for preparing to trade balance; go
with the downside breakout from the inside day. The above analysis was all
published before the fact through a service offered at J Dalton Trading.
Traders who were simply following rising prices and listening to price-based
analysis were likely caught long as the market began to break. Additionally,
these price-following traders were more likely to be buying breaks rather
than selling rallies.

Gaining an Edge

You constantly read and hear about the importance of traders “getting an edge.”
We have already discussed the importance of preparation, which builds the
initial base for obtaining an advantage over those who are less prepared. Here,
we’ll discuss two additional ways for gaining an edge—learning to read and
interpret market structure, and becoming an odds-based trader.

In Figure 7.7, you see December 14, 2012, represented by a one-
dimensional, 30-minute bar chart on the left, and a two-dimensional Market
Proﬁle on the right. The 30-minute bar chart lacks dimension and structure; it
does not graphically depict the critical fact that all prices are not equal.

The Market Proﬁle shows the same open, high, low, and close, in
addition to showing time and volume performance at each price. The wider
a single price is, reading from right to left, the more time was spent at that
price. Additionally, by applying the price (cid:1) time ¼ volume equation, we can
estimate volume at each price level.

FIGURE 7.7 Conventional Bar Chart versus the Market Proﬁle Graphic

While we are not technically Proﬁle traders (we employ a range of
tools and interwoven analysis), we value the Market Proﬁle for its ability to
reveal the inherent inequality in different prices—information you can
leverage to trade more competitively. The multidimensional Proﬁle gives
structure to the market’s continuous two-way auction process. Learning to
read and interpret that structure can provide you with a serious edge,
because it helps you avoid the perils of price blindness.

The study and interpretation of structure is a lifelong endeavor, as no two
days are ever the same; this is an exciting and welcome challenge for many
professional traders.

The Fairest Price Revealed

The example above depicts a structure that indicates a market that has gotten
very short in the day timeframe. The POC, or fairest price at which business
is being conducted, is the longest line reading from left to right. Selling that

3GC07

05/14/2013

10:1:17

Page 310

takes place below the fairest price is an indication of traders’ willingness to
sell futures below the current day’s fairest price; traders refer to this as
selling “short-in-the hole,” or selling short at poor prices. There isn’t always
a short-covering rally following this pattern. However, the odds of proﬁting
from remaining short have decreased, and the odds of a rally to adjust short-
term inventory have increased.

The above example is from Friday, December 14, 2012, and was written
about on Saturday, December 15th. The capture shown in Figure 7.8 was
taken on Monday morning, December 17th, 33 minutes after the opening,
and shows the early rally. You can never prove it was a short-covering rally.
But from our experience, we’re comfortable identifying it as such.

Thinking in terms of odds will help keep you from becoming too focused
on price, which will help keep you out of bad trades. You may not have
wanted to go home long on the December 14th close, but taking home a
short was against the odds. Market structure—not price—contained the
information necessary to read Friday’s market.

Prior to the second edition of Mind Over Markets, we talked a lot about the
POC, but since then this acronym has evolved into the more conceptual
fairest price—the fairest price at which business is being
descriptor,

conducted. The last example revealed how the fairest price lens was
employed to identify a particular market condition and opportunity. This
was just one example of the power of the Proﬁle, and how it reveals the
continuous two-way auction process in an evolving visual schema.

Thinking Statistically

Few of us naturally think logically all the time. Most of us are ruled by
cascading waves of emotion, inﬂuenced by our environment and the day’s
events. Statistical thinking is hard, because it requires focus and parallel
processing, or thinking about several things at once. Some examples of this
type of contextual thinking include simultaneously assessing current market
direction, volume, and market structure—Proﬁle shape, daily settlement,
who’s buying or selling, and overall trade location within the daily, weekly,
and monthly bars. That’s a lot to keep straight and uncluttered in your brain.
Traders are prone to overestimating how much they understand about the
market by looking at price, and becoming overconﬁdent by the illusion of
certainty. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes in The Black Swan (New York:
Random House, 2007), “We tend to learn the precise, not the general.”
Nonlinear auctions occur when the illusion of certainty is shattered. And
when opinions are revealed to be illusory, human behavior can become
extremely erratic; nonlinear auctions often make some traders a lot of
money, while destroying the majority of those who have difﬁculty accepting
what is actually happening in the market.

& The Trader’s Dilemma

In our last example, price was going lower. However, the odds of downside
continuation were decreasing. The market is regulated through time—if you
don’t use the opportunity to adjust your position and time runs out, the
ﬁnancial consequences can be severe. Many traders are like new aggressive
male drivers in that they know the dangers, but believe it could never
happen to them. Understanding the odds adds a dimension to your thought
process that not only alerts you to asymmetric opportunities, but also keeps
you from becoming too focused on price and ending up on the wrong side of
the trade.

The best example of “The Trader’s Dilemma” was captured on ﬁlm over a
two-day period in early October 2011 at DePaul University in Chicago. We
were presenting and ﬁlming J Dalton Trading’s Live Market Seminar. The S&P

indices had been declining for several days on poor volume and structure
(volume should always be evaluated on a relative, rather than absolute,
basis). A sound structural review begins with understanding the attempted
direction on each day. Elongated structure that develops in the attempted
direction is viewed as positive for directional continuation. Truncated struc-
ture that develops in the direction of the auction is considered negative for
continuation.

As the ﬁnal day’s session began, Jim stated that, “This may be one of those
days that sees the market open weak, but close strong.” The odds appeared
to be building against the shorts; most traders simply continued to press the
current trend, as they were addicted to price movement. We have often
referred to this trader dilemma as being mesmerized by price.

During the session, traders sold each small rally, which was continually
adding to the short inventory. With about an hour to go, Jim asked who was
still short—a few nods indicated that some seminar participants were. Soon
after, with less than an hour remaining in the New York pit session, the
market rallied over 400 points.

The dilemma occurs when traders are compelled to act immediately upon
the information that indicates a struggling decline (in this example). Often,
this information has to be “carried forward” until there is completion to the
current auction. And completion generally occurs only after the laggard
longs have completed their liquidation, along with the laggard shorts, who
continue to sell.

When do you cover your shorts and when do you go long? You want to
cover your shorts when the odds are becoming overwhelming, even though
the auction may not yet be complete. You may elect to be a little late in
going long; the additional information you gain by being late may lower the
risk of being wrong in a big way. Failure to exercise control and patience will
likely result in you getting whipsawed.

& The Most Important Omission from the First
Printing in 1990

In the ﬁrst printing of this book, we talked about buying and selling tails in
Proﬁle structure. Tails represent short-term excess, while a lack of a buying
or selling tail represents an auction high or low that has not been completed.
We describe a lack of a buying or selling tail as a poor low, or a poor high.
While the concept of tails, or the lack thereof, remains true, we have since

developed a more nuanced appreciation for what causes poor lows and highs.
The lack of a tail may indicate that the market has gotten too long when
there is no selling tail, and too short when there is no buying tail.

This understanding—like all understanding—evolved over time. It is the
context that leads to the high or low that signals a deeper layer of meaning.
Volume will often be below the relative volume for the past several days;
tempo, or pace, will be halting or slow; and the Proﬁle will likely be more
truncated. Once the inventory is adjusted, the market often returns to take
out the initial high or low in order to complete the original auction—but this
action doesn’t always occur on the same day (one of the most damaging
trader tendencies is acting too soon).

The biggest disappointment is that there are no absolute answers.
Continual practice and observation are required before this information

becomes internalized, and can be appreciated and understood fully.

Emotional Markets

In a prior example, we reviewed the situation when a market gets too short
over time. The mirror formation would indicate the inverse—the potential
for a market that has gotten too long. A contextual understanding will likely
include this inventory imbalance building over multiple sessions, with
deteriorating volume and market structure (a Proﬁle becoming less elon-
gated). In the following example we will see a Proﬁle that quickly gets too
elongated, usually within a single session (Figure 7.9).

On December 13, 2012, the S&P indices broke hard and fast. As the
market began to break, multiple short-term timeframe traders continued to
pile onto the short side of the market—there was little thinking going on.
Traders have often heard us say, “Traders do what works until it doesn’t
work anymore.” Price-based traders continued to pressure the market on
the following day; the trade to sell every rally was still working. However,
inventory had become extremely short.

As we discussed earlier in the book, an elongated Market Proﬁle is a sign
of auction continuation. When the Proﬁle is too elongated, however, the
result (as shown above) is often just the opposite. This kind of information
can’t be internalized or even fully understood by reading a book—the
process of internalization begins with knowing what to look for. In the above
example, a day and a half prior to the recovery rally it was possible to begin
to visualize the recovery. And consider that even while the market was
auctioning lower, the potential for a short-covering rally was increasing.

A Landscape View of the Market

It is highly unlikely that simple systems will win over any reasonable
length of time. That’s why serious professional traders begin with a
landscape view of the markets—landscape referring to a bank of monitors
lit up to display potentially interconnected markets. While a trader may be
trading a single market, he or she should be acutely aware that other
markets could impact that single market. Examples include:
1. In some market environments, rising bond prices might inﬂuence stocks
negatively. In other situations, higher bonds prices might be seen as
positive for equities.

2. Depending upon the circumstance, a rising Dollar has the potential to be

positive or negative for stocks.

3. Crude oil is inﬂuenced by its own fundamentals, the Dollar, and the

economy.

With accumulated experience, you learn to keep a constant eye on
multiple markets, paying particular attention to sudden shifts in sentiment.

Personal Evolution

There is nothing quite so compelling as real personal anecdote. As the lead author
of this book, and a full-time trader, I (Jim Dalton) would like to share a summary
of my own experience with the Market Proﬁle. Hopefully this passage will provide
some insight and inspiration as you continue on your quest to becoming an
expert trader.

From the beginning, I was skeptical about analysis that treated all prices as
equal. After years in the markets, with a membership on the Chicago Board
of Trade (CBOT) and a founding membership on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE), I came to the conclusion that fundamental analysis is
generally too long term, often appearing out of touch with the market.
Auction market theory, on the other hand, seemed to offer the most
objective means of allocating the constant ﬂow of bids and offers.

I embraced the idea that auctions are really mechanisms for price discovery.
For example, if an auctioneer couldn’t get buyers to raise their bids as he
was attempting to get the auction underway, he would lower the bid. Once
the auction got going, it usually took one of two courses. If the auction
occurred as expected, rising prices would indicate that some bidders had
their orders ﬁlled, while others dropped out as prices increased. Eventually,
the auction would end as the last bidder bid. Volume decreased as prices
rose—this was the expected course, as higher prices were cutting off buyers.
The unexpected auction was far more complex and exciting: As prices
auctioned higher, volume increased with new bidders continually entering
the market. These kinds of auctions often end with an upward ﬂurry as the
laggards arrive (once I was introduced to the Gladwell’s Diffusion Model, I
more fully appreciated the auction process in all its nuances).

It was a much smaller step to grasp the concept of a continuous two-way
auction process—auctioning from high to low, and low to high—than to
consider the inﬂuence of the different participants on the auction process.
The Market Proﬁle served as an innovative way to organize these continual
two-way auctions in such a way that speciﬁc participant behavior could
sometimes be visualized. I’m often asked if the Proﬁle works. Or, more
commonly, if it still works. The better question is this: “Is the Market Proﬁle
a valid scientiﬁc way to organize data?”

The answer to that question is a deﬁnitive yes. The Proﬁle is constructed
using a constant, time, on the horizontal axis, and a variable, price, on the
vertical axis to form a distribution. Scientists have employed this method to
study and observe data for generations. Personally, I would much rather

study organized data than unorganized data; the Proﬁle is simply a valuable
tool for organizing objective information.

To be clear, I’m a trader, not a Proﬁle trader. However, the Proﬁle has
been invaluable to my analysis, and it has enabled my personal evolution
through decades of reading and interpreting data in its ever-changing
visualizations. The previous discussion around tails is a good example of
how the Proﬁle has enabled deeper insight into the patterns of human
behavior that often emerge.

Over time, our knowledge deepens through practice—and not just

practice, but correct practice (remember that golf swing metaphor).

When we begin to learn any skill we start with basic deﬁnitions. As time
goes on, we begin to internalize these basics. Then as we become
competent, we have internalized enough information to, for example,
play the piano well enough that the piece can be recognized by a patient
listener. We are not alone at this stage—countless would-be artists can play
that same tune well enough to be recognizable. In short, our skill level has
no meaningful revenue potential at this stage.

Reﬂect on how easy it has become for most of us to drive ourselves to the
store, yet we’re still nowhere close to becoming a racecar driver—or even a
New York taxi driver. If we want to advance professionally once the basics have
been acquired, we must continue to practice, learning one nuance at a time.
Setbacks of course occur when we have acquired so many nuances that we have
to begin to decide which are most important, as well as when a particular
nuance becomes irrelevant under changing conditions. Think of this as ruling
reason. For example, you may have six data points that suggest a positive bias for
price direction, but the one observation that points to a negative bias outweighs
those six. It is the ruling reason that drives your decision.

As you advance toward proﬁcient and expert, the information that is most
salient within the current context becomes easier to discern. A professional
baseball coach doesn’t routinely have his players attempt to steal home, but
under the right circumstances the risk/reward may be attractive enough to
attempt such a bold gambit. Most successful professionals have identiﬁed
multiple mentors, and constantly look to coaches to keep them on track. But
ﬁnding a coach that is truly knowledgeable (and affordable) is prohibitive for
most people, traders included.

Below, we have attempted to list many of the nuances that you must deal
with every day. And while listing and describing them is far easier than
internalizing them, we believe that once you have these nuances in mind,
you will be in a better position to constantly observe them, honing your
ability to effectively employ them as part of your trading strategy. An
important part of this internalization process includes recognizing the
changing hierarchy of this subtle information from day to day.

& Timeframe Control—Who Is Dominating
the Current Session?

It will be more practical, in the earlier stages of your career, if you think in
terms of day timeframe, and then “all the others.” But as you become more
experienced, you will begin to see four timeframes: day, short-term,
intermediate-term, and long-term.

On days when the day timeframe is in control, the trading is likely to be
restrained with lower volume, less range extension, and guided by very
mechanical references. Among these references:
1. The opening, which may be a day-timeframe guide for the entire day.
2. Halfback, which is simply the center of the range, and provides a
dynamic reference point that changes as the daily range extends on the
high or low.

3. Unchanged, or “unched” in trader lingo, which is simply the settle of the

previous day.
Additionally, the high and low from overnight trading—as well as the
previous day, week, and month—will be very much in play. Weekly highs
and lows are only relevant to the day trader if they are easily within range.
When the day timeframe is in control, you are far more likely to experience
nonexcess highs and lows, which simply indicate a lack of buying or selling
tails. We also refer to these as poor or unsecured lows and highs. During
these days, you’re much more likely to see day timeframe inventory
becoming too short or too long, with constant counter auctions to correct
the day timeframe inventory imbalance.

When the other timeframe is in control, the references listed above will
be far less signiﬁcant; in fact, long-term traders may not even acknowledge
some of them as references. Day-timeframe traders attempting to apply
these references (or anchors) when the other timeframe is in control are
likely to get run over. How many times have we heard day- and short-term

traders say that they gave back three weeks of proﬁtable trading in one day?
Many times we’ve also heard it said, “If it weren’t for that one day, my
month would have been proﬁtable.” It is critical to day- and short-term
traders to respect the dominance of the longer timeframes, who always
trump the actions of the shorter timeframes.

The other timeframe is more likely to recognize a multiple day trading
range. Interchangeable terms are balance areas or trading brackets, highs
and lows, weekly and monthly extremes, unﬁlled gaps, and common
knowledge moving averages. More alert and experienced day-timeframe
traders who are able to quickly recognize who’s in control pile on to the
auctions driven by the longer timeframe. These adaptable day traders shift
their strategy and tactics from more mundane rotational trading to
momentum trading. The less experienced day trader is fading or going
against the action of the longer timeframes. The addiction to price—the
temptation to sell at a price higher than they could previously, or buy at a
price lower than they could previously—cannot be resisted . . . they step
in front of the proverbial train.

& Markets Are Visual

A standard bar chart is the best way to identify visual references, such as
trading range highs and lows, as well as weekly and monthly extremes. Most
people have a tendency to view the 24-hour electronic bar chart rather than
view a bar chart that includes the pit sessions only. As of this writing, the
New York or Chicago pit sessions are still the center of trading for most U.S.
listed equities and world commodities. For this reason, we view a bar chart
for the U.S. pit session, and may separately view 24-hour bar charts,
particularly for the currencies. We do this so that we can view gaps between
the U.S. day sessions. We deﬁne a gap as an opening that occurs outside of
the previous day’s high or low (we don’t measure gaps from the close of the
prior day). We also view U.S. day session bar charts for daily, weekly, and
monthly trading ranges and excess highs and lows. This affords us an
opportunity to see visual areas on the bar charts that may be destinations for
current directional auctions, hereafter referred to as “destination trades.”
We are often asked why we use bar charts, rather than composite
Proﬁles, for long-term charts. The reason is that long-term, composite
Proﬁles can contain too much information, and hide important structural
information such as the gaps and trading range highs and lows we just

discussed. Additionally, signiﬁcant references—points such as daily,
weekly, and monthly highs and lows—may blend into the composite,
where they are lost.

Destination Trades

Destination trades are far easier to grasp when you appreciate what
timeframe is dominating, as well as the visual nature of the markets’
prominent reference points. Once a directional auction gets underway, the
auction tends to travel to a very visual reference. For a day timeframe trade,
for example, the reference may be the previous day’s high or low, a three-
day high or low, or to the top or bottom of a gap.

The destination for a long-term trade may be from a ﬁve-month bracket
high or low to the opposite extreme of that bracket; it may take days, weeks,
or months to reach the destination. Of course destinations don’t have to be
reached, but they always serve as benchmarks to chart market progress. We
often say, “Put the trade on and monitor for continuation.” Understanding
possible destinations will help you maintain a better perspective of the
multiple auctions, and help you better gauge your position’s performance.
For example, it is not uncommon to have a long-term auction to the upside
with an intermediate-term corrective auction to the downside, as well as a
day timeframe trend day to the upside. Employing destination areas from the
bar charts will help you sort out this potentially conﬂicting data, and keep
this information out of the abstract.

The Opening

The Market Proﬁle is a time-sensitive, evolving database that records the
market’s continuous two-way auction process, the study of which is termed
Auction Market Theory. The opening is the ﬁrst recorded data point each day;
we want to observe if the market opens within balance (within the previous
day’s range) or out of balance (outside of the previous day’s range). Of
course, in or out of balance is a matter of degree. If we opened just four ticks
below yesterday’s high, for example, we would still be in balance.
However, the odds are higher that the market will trade out of balance
to the upside, or failing that, begin to trade toward the previous day’s low.
The more out of balance we are to begin the day, the greater the
opportunities; the more out of balance we are, the greater the odds that
the other timeframe is responsible. Remaining within balance limits traders

to much smaller opportunities. When in balance, the odds are also much
greater that trading is being dominated by the day timeframe.

Trends
We have simpliﬁed the timeframes down to two. For this discussion, we will
determine the direction of the long- and short-term trend. The deﬁnition of
a trend is entirely dependent upon your own timeframe. At a minimum, we
generally want to trade with the direction of the short-term trend. And if
you are trading against the trend, you want good trade location, and you
want your trade to work quickly. Trade location is the best risk control we
have available. Let’s review an example (Figure 7.10).

Remember, these concepts are applicable to all timeframes—from 30-

minute bars to daily, weekly, monthly bars, and so on.
1. The current trading range evolved from the nonlinear break in early
September 2012. You will often ﬁnd that these types of breaks (or
rallies) deﬁne the extremes of the brackets that develop thereafter. This
initial range is validated with the Excess Low 2 to the Excess High 3.
2. If you look to the left of the Excess Low 2 you will see four weekly lows;
the excess low occurred when price explored below the prior four
weekly lows and found aggressive opportunistic buyers responding to the
lower prices. We refer to this attempt to break below the trading range’s
lower extreme and the rejection that followed as a downside breakout

failure. This is often a strong signal that change has occurred, and
provides attractive trade location. Remember: Trading is about change, and
without change there are no meaningful opportunities. Excess marks the
moment of change.

3. The short-term auction to the upside ended with the excess high. Excess
and balance are the two most powerful concepts we employ. The rally
began with a look below the four-week balance that led to the Excess
Low 2 and signaled the start of a new upward auction. The weekly one-
timeframed higher until Excess High 3 formed. One-timeframing occurs
when, in the case of a rising market, the next weekly low does not take
out (trade below) the low of the prior week. Of course, it is a mirror
image for a declining market when the next weekly high does not take
out the prior week’s high. One-timeframing occurs in all timeframes.
You want to respect the direction of the one-timeframing auction, and in
most instances trade with it.

4. Following Excess High 3, the Short-Term Trend 4 rotated back down.
This excess marked the end of one auction and the beginning of a new
auction to the downside.

5. The destination trade was to the bottom of the trading range; the prior
Excess Low is seen as the potential destination. The identiﬁcation of the
potential destination was based upon experience and observation. As we
approach the destination, the risk for the shorts has increased and the
odds of remaining proﬁtable in the short position have deteriorated.
Momentum traders often get caught at these levels as momentum is
often the highest at excess lows and highs. Remember, excess is mostly
the result of momentum traders taking the auction to extremes. Excess is
identiﬁed after the fact—after the innovator has stepped in to oppor-
tunistically fade the laggard momentum traders.

6. The weekly settle following the completion to the destination.

Reﬂect on the risk/reward at different levels along the continuum from high
to low. This same analysis is relevant to all timeframe trades. For day traders,
we suggest using the daily Market Proﬁle, and placing a green pin on the Proﬁle
for each buy, and a red pin for each sell. After the day is over, review your
overall trade location—if a majority of the pins are within the fattest portion of
the Proﬁle, then you are trading with the majority; you are not getting an edge
and are unlikely to be proﬁtable. If too many of your green pins are near the
higher end of the Proﬁle, and the red pins are near the lower portion, then your
trading is of the laggard category, and you are likely to get whipsawed.

Daily Perspective

Every day, we seek a balanced perspective by seeking to determine the
nature of any existing trends, which timeframe is dominating, whether
the opening is in or out of balance, and so on, as well as the opportunity that
each of these situations reveals—trade location, potential visual destina-
tions, and evolving structural cues.

Cognitive Dissonance
All humans feel an acute discomfort when we ﬁnd ourselves holding two
opposing thoughts. This is an extremely common emotion shared by
traders. But cognitive dissonance can actually be positive for those traders
who are willing to think through the source of that dissonance. For
example, it is powerful to recognize that a market is rising, but the higher
it goes without conﬁrming structure and volume, the better the downside
opportunity to follow. The trend may be your friend, but it is equally
important to recognize when that trend is ending. Being prepared for
change affords us the best trade location and opportunity. Let’s see this
process in action (Figure 7.11).

As we approach the end of the Second Edition of Mind Over Markets, our
examples are getting more complex. Figure 7.11 serves to establish the
background for this discussion.

Hopefully, by this point you’re feeling like you did the last time you
visited your ophthalmologist—as you sat behind the refractor staring at
rows of fuzzy letters, you noticed how they came in and out of focus.
Hopefully this is occurring now as the layers of information that have been
presented are beginning to form a recognizable whole.
1. Markets continually auction from high to low, and low to high. This
example begins with an excess high. An excess high marks the
completion of one auction and the beginning of a new auction. It is
always helpful
the current auction has been
if
completed. Excess is one way that an auction can end, but it is not
uncommon for an auction to be temporality suspended as a result of
inventory getting too long or too short. This leads to short-term
counter-auctions. We often say, “The market has to take care of
current business ﬁrst.” Regardless of whether the long-term trend is up
or down, these moves often create short-term inventory imbalances
that need to be adjusted.

to ask yourself

2. Following an excess high, the market gaps lower. The message behind a
gap is that a total reorientation in thinking has taken place, along with the
market’s perception of value. A gap is another form of excess. The
combination of an excess high followed by a gap deserves respect.
3. The possibility of a suspended intermediate-term auction presents itself
as a short-term counter-auction begins.1 There is never any certainty
until after the fact. However, as you become more skilled at reading and
interpreting the market’s two-way auction process, you can better assess
the odds that it was a suspension.

4. A clear excess low is revealed. Remember, excess and balance are the

two most powerful trading concepts we deal with.

5. Following the excess low, the market begins to one-timeframe higher.
One-timeframing is an important piece of auction information; it is
generally ﬁnancially dangerous to trade counter to one-timeframing.

6. An excess high forms.
7. An inside day—a form of balance—develops following the excess high.
The general trading rule is to go with any breakout from balance,
which marks the start of a new auction. Once again, change has
occurred.

1 Notice also that these two similar weekly lows lack excess—they are considered a poor or
unsecured low, albeit on the daily bar chart. We will come back to this later in the
discussion.

Take a moment to reﬂect back on the suspended auction discussed under
item 3. The poor low that formed suggested that it would be revisited or
repaired at some time in the future, as there was no excess—in other words,
no aggressive buying that led to an excess low.

Recording and carrying this information forward is important for reading
the subtleties of the continuous two-way auction process. Many traders
complain that this type of information is simply too ambiguous, yet the
market’s best opportunities are often hidden in the subtleties of market-
generated information.

Having reviewed the overall market and a series of auctions, it’s time to

transition to the real discussion.

The previous example shown in Figure 7.12 included a suspended
downward auction followed by a market that was ﬁnding ways to work
itself higher. We suspect that there were two underlying causes for the
auction going higher:
1. The market had gotten extremely short following the excess high seen in

our ﬁrst daily bar chart.

2. The Federal Reserve had reafﬁrmed its decision to support the bond

market by keeping rates low.
In Figure 7.12, you notice that each day’s low was established in the
initial pit session 30-minute Y period, which allows us to easily determine
that the attempted direction was up. The basic question that we ask each day

is: “What was the market trying to do, and how effective was the effort?” A
solid attempt to trade higher would begin with value beginning to develop
higher, which we see revealed in the Proﬁles. Additionally, the Proﬁle
structure would be much more elongated, with most prices attracting no
more than ﬁve or six TPO prints. In the above example, some prices
attracted as many as 10 letters—a lot of time was spent trading at these
prices. This is not a science, but rather the art of reading and interpreting
market structure. Some markets are open for shorter periods, while others,
like bonds and stocks, are open for longer periods. The amount of time spent
trading at a particular level, relative to the pit session hours, affects our
analysis of this data.

On a solid day, the market is more likely to settle near the higher end of
the range. In the above example, the settle of each of the last two days is well
off of the highs. At the time, I found myself holding two contrasting opinions:
1) The larger auction was down and had been temporarily suspended, and
2) the short-covering and short-term momentum buying was occurring,
which was related to the Federal Reserve’s FOMC release. We always want
to trade value, and value was developing higher each day; no matter what my
opinion of the long-term, you don’t want to fade or go against value.

This is a good opportunity to reﬂect back on systems that trade price. In
this instance, price was trading higher each day. Yet, while value was also
trading higher, the Market Proﬁles were revealing structural weakness
that demonstrated slowing momentum. The odds of upside continuation
were weakening, while the odds of a market reversal were increasing. The
break that began on Friday, December 7, 2012, took the market down
approximately $5,000 per contract over a period of six days before a new
excess low emerged. The suspended auction that we discussed earlier was
revisited and repaired, meaning that the poor, or in this case suspended
auction, no longer existed.

Imagination

The career of a professional trader is largely dependent upon his or her
imagination—if you can’t imagine what might occur, it will be difﬁcult for
you to recognize market opportunities as they arise. You will end up taking
small proﬁts and fading larger opportunities that lead to net losses, when a
chance for larger proﬁt was right in front of you. We foresaw such a scenario
in real time when we discussed a similar market situation while recording
our Live Markets Seminar in October 2011.

In the above example, a substantial opportunity was identiﬁed through
positive cognitive dissonance; the dissonance was observing one rising
auction and sensing that a reversal was probable. The deteriorating auction,
when combined with carrying forward information conveyed by the
suspended auction, allowed us to imagine and capitalize on a large
opportunity to the downside.

False Certainty

Traders are prone to overestimate how much they understand about the
markets by looking at price, which often causes them to become
overconﬁdent. Nonlinear auctions occur, as we have often stated,
when the illusion of certainty is shattered. I’m writing this on Sunday
morning, December 23, 2012; during the electronic trade on Thursday
evening, December 20, such an illusion was shattered, which brieﬂy
took the S&P indices limit down. Let’s examine the market leading up to
this break.

The ﬁnal line in our daily S&P Pre-Market Update, published just prior to
the break, read: “I continue to be concerned regarding underlying structure.
Thursday’s anomalies contribute to my concern.” This was an odds-based
comment—I certainly didn’t foresee a limit down move in just a few hours.
However, the odds of holding long inventory appeared to be extraordinarily
high. Much of this conclusion was based upon structural analysis, which was
similar to the analysis discussed in the last bond example. Two additional
contributing observations are discussed below.

An anomaly, as described under the glossary on our website, is a single price
or price level that lacks symmetry—an unusual structural arrangement in
the Market Proﬁle. An anomaly represents structural weakness. Learning to
spot anomalies is the ﬁrst step toward understanding the pivotal information
that anomalies provide. See the Market Proﬁle from Thursday, December
20, 2012, in Figure 7.13.

The Proﬁle shows a single price anomaly, as well as a price-level anomaly.
In addition, there was a series of poor lows—another indication of structural
weakness.

Markets in Proﬁle, published in 2007, discusses timeframes extensively.
When longer timeframes are active in the market, they tend to be more

aggressive on the highs and lows. Their interest will be more evident
through single-print buying and selling tails. When tails are nonexistent,
the higher and lower structural portions of the Proﬁle lack excess. In the
above S&P example, the lack of buying tails for three successive days is
an indication that the market is being dominated by short-term, weaker-
hands traders. These are the traders that impulsively liquidate and
reverse their positions at the ﬁrst sign of a problem. A single poor
low represents one data point, which I give limited attention. But
multiple poor lows represent exponential risk to those holding long
positions. The graphic in Figure 7.14 shows that risk as the market
traded limit down.

Exponential Risk as Market Traded Limit Down

Market Logic

It is not unusual for market logic to supersede all other analysis and
understanding. During the period leading up to Thursday’s overnight limit
down break, short-term traders—who were afraid that they would miss the
anticipated rally following a favorable outcome between the president and
Congress to keep the country from falling off of ﬁscal cliff—couldn’t buy
enough. As often happens, they were misguided in their actions and paid a
severe price. Additionally, many reversed their positions only to experience
another whipsaw.

3GC07

05/14/2013

10:1:19

Page 329

Other examples of market logic include what didn’t happen; almost all
traders can accurately report what actually occurred during a trading
session, but professional traders reﬂect on what didn’t happen. What could
have happened and didn’t is often extremely valuable information. For
example, when a negative Monthly Jobs Report fails to lead to a declining
market, the market will likely rally—those left staring at the report are
unable to trade with the market, and experience negative cognitive
dissonance.

As we’ve often stated, the Market Proﬁle is a valuable analytic tool for
recording and interpreting the market, but it should not be employed in a
vacuum.

& We Are All Day Traders

No matter what timeframe trader you are, we are all day traders on the day
we enter and exit a position. And how we enter our initial trade, no matter
our timeframe, will ultimately inﬂuence our subsequent actions. Under-
standing that inﬂuence—both positive and negative—is vital to success.
Positive psychology is an important element for successful trading; knowing
how your emotions inﬂuence your behavior is just as important as under-
standing the fundamental market dynamics discussed in this book. For
example, most traders are far too eager to get involved as the market opens,
for fear of missing an opportunity. When such a feeling is controlling you,
the odds are good that you’ll make an impulsive trade as a result. It is
common knowledge that impulsive trades seldom work out.

When markets open within balance relative to the previous day’s range,
the opportunities are usually limited, and it’s probably best to wait for better
trade location. In this situation, the additional information gathered while
waiting will give you a more complete, coherent picture of who is driving
market behavior. View the opening on a continuum relative to the previous
day’s range—the closer to the center of the range, the lower the odds that
you need to trade early; the closer you are to the previous day’s extremes,
the more likely that you can beneﬁt from early entry. The more out of
balance the market is relative to the center of the range, the greater the
opportunities. Attractive opportunities usually develop around gap open-
ings, as gaps reveal the ultimate out-of-balance experience. The bigger the
gap, the smaller the odds that the gap will be ﬁlled during the current trading
day. This may feel counterintuitive, but the bigger the gap the more likely

that longer timeframe traders are caught the wrong way, and will have to
trade in the direction of the gap to adjust their existing inventory.
Free from distractions, we continue until we reach our goal . . .

While it may seem strange to quote a swami in a book on trading, we can
think of no better goal than the one commonly described by wise folks
throughout the ages: We must free ourselves from attachment to desired outcomes if
we are to see the world as it really is. In reading this book, you have made
progress on your path to becoming a successful trader. Over time, you will
transform these insights into instincts in the kiln of experience. And those
instincts will help you rise above the distracting maelstrom of conﬂicting
information with a broader, more holistic market perspective. You will
begin to understand the big picture, while also participating in the daily
minutia—that is the hallmark of a professional trader.

Developing this level of market understanding is not an easy process.
Most people ﬁnd it impossible to even parse ambiguous, conﬂicting
information, let alone transcend it. But armed with awareness, you have
the ability to separate yourself from your competitors, most of whom are
lost in the shallows of price and opinion. You have the opportunity to forge
your own path toward expert. Good luck on your journey!

Value-Area
Calculation

The value area represents the area of greatest trade facilitation and

acceptance of value in the day timeframe and is signiﬁed by the price
region where 70 percent of the day’s volume occurred. It can be calculated
using either actual price/volume numbers or approximated by substituting
TPOs when volume is not available.

331

& Volume Value-Area Calculation

Figure A1.1 illustrates how to calculate the volume value area. First, identify
the price at which the greatest volume occurred. Then, sum the volumes
occurring at the two prices directly above the high-volume price and
compare it to the total volume of the two prices below the high-volume
price. The dual price total with the highest volume becomes part of the value
area. This process continues until 70 percent of the volume is reached.

In Figure A1.1, the greatest volume (22,168) occurred at 96–12. The
total volume for the two prices above 96–12 is 34,491 (Sum of Dual Prices)
and the two price total below is 43,773. Since the lower total is greater, it is
added to the high-volume price as part of the value area. The same process is
repeated, comparing the next two lower prices (96–15 and 96–16), to
96–10 and 96–11 again. The lower total is higher and is, therefore, the next
addition to the developing value area. This process is repeated until the
volume reaches 70 percent of the day’s total volume.

The calculation of the TPO value area follows the same general steps as the
volume value area. First, count the total number of TPOs, including the
single prints. Take 70 percent of this number to establish how many TPOs
approximate 70 percent of the day’s volume. Then, examine the two prices
above and below the longest line on the Proﬁle, adding the two with a

TPO versus
Volume Proﬁles

335

Humans have a fascination with numbers. We crave exactness and abhor

ambiguity; if we can’t comfortably comprehend a piece of information,
we often discard it in favor of contrary indicators that match our precon-
ceived notions. Yet it is precisely in moments of uncertainty that the
experienced trader identiﬁes opportunity, like the savvy angler who looks
for a subtle ripple in the slow water below a snag.

Consider volume, which can serve to validate market opportunities. You
must constantly ask yourself, “Is volume validating the current market
direction?” Volume proﬁles (not to be confused with Market Proﬁles) show
you exactly how much volume—including relative volume—occurred at
each price, as well as the exact number of contracts for the entire session.
See the example in Figure A2.1.

To reiterate, the three main components of the auction process are:

1. Price—advertises all opportunities.
2. Time—regulates all opportunities.
3. Volume—measures the success or failure of advertised opportunities.
It’s important to note that what the volume proﬁle does not show is far
more important to the way I trade that what it actually displays. I believe it is
the more ambiguous combination of time and volume—rather than volume
alone—that provides the most timely, relevant insight (when considered
within the larger market context). Volume is important, but so is time,
because a price that is not accepted over time is, in fact, rejected.

FIGURE A2.1 Volume Example

All traders know the psychological pressure of time (tick, tick, tick). Being
in a trade that begins to stall can create serious psychological doubt. And the
longer a trade fails to advance in our favor, the longer we have to sit there
imagining what might be going wrong. For example, the late liquidation or
short-covering rally in the pit session may be the result of time running out for
day traders, rather than a lack of volume. The most likely scenario is that these
situations are caused by a combination of both factors.

& Single Price Level Distortions

It is not uncommon to witness much higher volume at or around a single
price level. For example, the previous day’s high or low, or the overnight

3GBAPP02

04/23/2013

11:35:4

Page 337

high or low, is likely to attract above-average trade. Additional examples
include the opening and the halfback. When viewed on an absolute-volume
basis, these levels may appear to be far more important than they deserve to
be. Therefore, it’s imperative to view volume in relation to time, which is
more likely to smooth out these prominent levels, allowing us to better
maintain a more complete overall perspective.

& End of Day Total Volume versus Ongoing
Volume throughout the Day

Markets often develop a direction, or tone, for a single day. This direction
may not be conﬁrmed by volume, however, even while the auction
continues until the close. In many instances, the movement is corrected
the following day due to lack of volume. In other words, there is often a
delay in the effect that such a low-volume move may have on a market.

& Anomalies

An anomaly is a single price or price level that lacks symmetry, which
creates an unusual shape in the Market Proﬁle. Anomalies represent
structural weakness, and they’re created through a combination of time
and price—and therefore may not show up on volume proﬁles. In fact,
volume proﬁles alone often identify false anomalies, such as the previous
day’s high or low, as discussed earlier. These points of structural weakness
are often revisited during the current or following trading session.

The graphic in Figure A2.2 will help make this point.
It’s hard to believe that these two charts are from the same market on the
same day. The difference is revealed by combining volume and time. In a
conventionally constructed Market Proﬁle, volume is estimated by multi-
plying price x time—the greater the number of TPOs reading from left to
right, the higher the estimated volume. While this method isn’t perfect, I
believe it offers superior insight to volume in a vacuum.

The Market Proﬁle—with its extremely visual, pattern-forming TPOs—
enables me to better answer pivotal questions about how volume is being
distributed throughout the day:
& Is volume being distributed within a rotational market?

& Is volume being distributed as part of a trend?

FIGURE A2.2 TPO Proﬁles Next to Volume Proﬁles

I start a new Market Proﬁle anytime I think that a new directional auction
is underway. That way, I can compare the new volume to the old volume
within the context of distinct directional movements.

3GBAPP02

& Too Focused on Volume

Of course, volume is only one element to consider during any given trading
day. Among the other considerations (discussed elsewhere in this book, and
in Markets in Proﬁle) are:
& Value—developing higher, lower, overlapping, and so on.

& Which timeframe is in control (this is paramount).

& Rotational trading day.

& Trend day.

& One-timeframing.

& Short covering.

& Long liquidation.

& Conclusion

After a lifetime spent observing markets, I choose to give more emphasis to
structure—
the Market Proﬁle—with its evolving, multidimensional
because I believe it provides a more accurate representation of the auction
process by juxtaposing volume and time. In addition, it smooths out aberra-
tions when there is high volume at the opening price, as well as other static
references, like the prior pit session high and low, and the overnight high
and low.

Ultimately, you must make your own decisions as you carefully choose
which tools you use and which indicators you follow as you trade. Rest
assured that no matter what you decide, there is never a single, simple
answer. I suggest you compare volume proﬁles and Market Proﬁles side by
side, writing down your observations as you see how they mirror and/or
contradict each other. What does the ambiguity tell you? Can you identify
change before your competitors (mostly laggards) transform opportunity
into the familiar patterns of consensus?
