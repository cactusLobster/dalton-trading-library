1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Thank you.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Welcome, everyone, to the Field of Vision video with Jim Dalton.

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,900
Thank you for being here today.

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,740
And we have a full day to hear Jim share 40 years of market understanding and market experience

6
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,660
and trading experience with us.

7
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,080
And we're all very fortunate to be a part of it.

8
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:33,900
Jim's taken a lot of time to lay the slides out and the material out in a way that we can fit as much info as possible with our time here today.

9
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:43,420
And he's also laid it out and put a lot of thought into how to structure it so that it'll flow and you can absorb it and go home and start implementing it in your trading regimen.

10
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,080
Obviously, that's why we're here, to trade better.

11
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,620
And that's how this program was designed for you to go home and trade.

12
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,260
Jim, I've been working with Jim about a year.

13
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,960
And he has asked me to just talk a little bit about the learning process because he's watched me struggle.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,840
And at the same time, he's watched me come to a new level of trading.

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,500
And I do believe that this is an edge we develop within ourselves.

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
It's not an edge from an indicator or a strategy or a methodology.

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,260
This is something that we are developing internally, intuitively.

18
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,060
We are developing what we see.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,700
No one can take it from us once we have it.

20
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,840
And to me, that's very exciting because when I am trading well, it's like hitting a golf ball really well.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,900
You change your grip.

22
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,400
It is nothing but hook and slice and pain.

23
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,980
And then one time you hit it and it just feels perfect.

24
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,740
And when I'm trading like that with Jim, that's the feeling.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,300
And it makes it all worth it.

26
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,860
So I just want to throw that out there because it isn't easy and it won't come overnight.

27
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,940
But stick with it because I do believe that we really have a true edge here.

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,700
And to utilize 40 years, we don't have to make a new path and reinvent the wheel.

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,680
We can learn from someone who didn't have a mentor, who is now here because he wants to offer something that he didn't have and share with us.

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,420
I do want to say one other thing that I did hear when I was signing up for this and investing the money.

31
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,860
I was hesitant and a gentleman said to me when I asked him, should I try it?

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,180
Should I invest this money?

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,400
And he said, absolutely.

34
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,100
And he had no vested interest in Jim Dalton.

35
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,640
He said, you will never look at the markets the same way again.

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:41,720
And I can genuinely say that from a year ago when I started, I will never look at the markets the same way again.

37
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,440
And there's much more depth and there's much more interrelationships I consider.

38
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,020
And the longer I go through it, the more it becomes more intuitive and natural to me.

39
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,480
And I'm very grateful to be a part of it.

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,240
So with that, if you will help me welcome Mr. Jim Dalton.

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
Julia, thank you.

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,060
Thank you very much.

43
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,720
I've watched Julia go through this process and we were doing an intensive out in Napa.

44
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,980
It was the last day of the intensive.

45
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,540
We had about an hour to go.

46
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,900
And I looked out and she was kind of leaning over the desk.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
Her eyes were about this big.

48
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,940
And I knew at that point in time that the information that we have talked about had absolutely overwhelmed her.

49
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,460
And it was really at that point that she really made the turning point.

50
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,180
I talked to her the following week.

51
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,040
And that turning point came and you could see the growth take place.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:03,620
One of the best compliments I think we've ever received, Rick in the middle was telling me yesterday about one of the blogs that he was reading.

53
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,440
And one of the blogs, somebody asked about the program that we offer.

54
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,320
And they said, no, it was too complex and too complicated.

55
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,160
It wasn't for them.

56
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,000
That is probably the finest compliment we've ever received because that is 100% true.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,760
If it was, Julia said it, if it was easy, there would be no edge.

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,840
If there was easy, if it was easy, it would be replicated almost overnight.

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,540
It is not easy.

60
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,180
It is a process that you will go through.

61
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,060
But understand that the rewards are huge if you make it.

62
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Not many people are going to make the entire process.

63
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,080
But we're trying to give you a foundation.

64
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,760
Once you have that foundation, then you start to build on the foundation.

65
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,400
Let's start off and let's just begin to review some of the basics that are involved.

66
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,120
The tool that we use is called Market Profile.

67
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,920
However, Market Profile is simply a tool.

68
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:20,360
What we are talking about is about trading and all of the intricacies and the interrelationships that occur when you're trading.

69
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,700
So many people want to know only where do I get in and where do I get out.

70
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,540
It is clearly not that simple.

71
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,780
It is far more complex than that.

72
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,820
What we talk about is trading.

73
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,600
We use the Market Profile.

74
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,980
We call it the Market Profile graphic.

75
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:52,520
And you'll see as we develop it is when you look at a graphic, a graphic is something that brings together many complex points at one time.

76
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:01,020
The most famous graphic in the world is the graphic of Napoleon's army going into Russia.

77
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:09,340
From just one simple graphic, you see the size of the army as Napoleon started.

78
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:16,180
You see how the army shrinks, you see the temperature change, you see the distribution of food.

79
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:28,780
From one simple graphic, the most famous graphic in the world, you can understand an awful lot of very complex information in a way that our minds are very welcoming.

80
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,360
We welcome looking at graphical type of information.

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:43,220
And so this is what, when we get to the Market Profile graphic, you will see that it is in fact very similar to this famous graphic.

82
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,160
Okay, let's take a look and start off.

83
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,280
This is just to get you started.

84
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,800
This gives you some idea of where we're going to be when we're all done.

85
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,040
Remember, this is not basic right here.

86
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,760
This is kind of how we look at days.

87
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,740
For example, up at the top, you'll see something labeled afternoon pullback low.

88
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,940
If you have a trend day, a trend day being a day where the market has moved rapidly, say to the upside,

89
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,920
very often late in the afternoon, you will get a pullback or you'll get a little inventory correction.

90
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:30,860
Most people have no idea the significance of that very minor point where the market pulled back.

91
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,420
That reference point, late in the afternoon, until it's taken out, nothing's really changed in the marketplace.

92
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
So we're going to talk about that.

93
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,340
We're going to talk about the significance of how do you identify when change takes place.

94
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,640
We look along here and we look at significant highs and lows.

95
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,240
Triple references.

96
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,500
We look at what you're going to be introduced to is called the point of control.

97
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,860
Point of control or the fairest price at which business is being conducted.

98
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,680
It's very important.

99
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,760
If the fairest price at which business is being conducted throughout the day doesn't change,

100
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,940
then you don't have a lot of change in the market.

101
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,640
Sometimes you'll see that start to migrate.

102
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,740
So all this is just some idea of where you're going to be when we're done with this.

103
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,440
That is a point of control right there.

104
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,580
You'll understand the significance of that or the fairest price to do business as we complete this.

105
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,720
You'll understand the importance of the references.

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:44,700
Anyhow, this just gives you some feel of what it's going to look like and what you're going to start to understand as we get to the last portion of this presentation.

107
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,020
Okay, let's take a look structure.

108
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,200
Another comment in here that you're going to understand.

109
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:02,660
If you think back and visualize a bar chart, most people that have ever traded look at a bar chart.

110
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,740
A bar chart is a straight line.

111
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,500
On that bar chart, you have an open, high, low, and close.

112
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
Okay, you have basically four data points.

113
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,100
You have no dimension to that bar chart.

114
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,980
When you look at a profile, and we haven't explained to you yet how you build a profile,

115
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,060
but you can look and see that it is not a straight line.

116
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,540
When we add another dimension, we get into what we call market structure.

117
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,060
We will be talking about what is strong structure, what is weak structure.

118
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,220
Just a few days ago, the market had a historic break.

119
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,820
The Dow was down over 1,000 points late in the afternoon on a huge drop,

120
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,380
and then the market rebounded over 700 points before you knew what time it was.

121
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,020
If the underlying structure of that market had been strong,

122
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,800
I suspect we would not have had that kind of break.

123
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Those that have been looking at the material that we've done for some period of time

124
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,760
know that I've been writing about the risk inherent in weak market structure.

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
But you'll start to learn about structure.

126
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,200
You'll learn what it means.

127
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,000
You'll also learn, just as you would if you had a house with shindles on it and you had a leak,

128
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,260
you'll start to learn how do you repair that house.

129
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,060
How do you repair or what happens to repair poor structure in the marketplace.

130
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,720
I don't expect you to understand any of this right now.

131
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,200
All I want to give you is a flavor of the depth of which we're going to get to

132
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,380
before we complete this process.

133
00:11:51,380 --> 00:12:00,500
Okay, at its foundation, the market is simply a two-way auction process.

134
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,580
The motives and incentives of the buyers and sellers are infinite.

135
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:15,220
But let's talk a little bit about an auction process so you get a feel for it.

136
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,140
Most people have been to some kind of an auction.

137
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,140
Generally, the auctions you've been to are maybe an art auction.

138
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:31,300
Or at one time, years ago, I had a client that owned the Galleria down in Texas.

139
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,620
When he used to come in to the programs, he would fly in on his own plane.

140
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,940
He would take the whole floor of one of the hotels.

141
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,120
And he'd been to three or four of the programs.

142
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,280
And I said, you know, you keep coming back.

143
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,280
I said, how is this working for you?

144
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,960
He said, well, you know, Mr. Dalton, he said, I'm still not doing a wonderful job of trading the market.

145
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,760
But he said, in my life, he said, I buy ponies at the auctions all the time.

146
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,780
And he said, they're sure not getting the best of me at the auctions for the ponies anymore.

147
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,420
He said, I know what's going on.

148
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,300
And he said, I can't tell you what you've done for me, learning to understand how an auction really functions.

149
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,720
And he said, I thought I knew.

150
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,120
Well, let's walk through an auction process.

151
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,960
In a traditional auction process, it goes one way.

152
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,080
Let's start with kind of an expensive art object.

153
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:34,520
If the auctioneer is trying to get the auction started at, say, $100,000, what happens if nobody will lift the bid at $100,000?

154
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,740
What does the auctioneer have to do now?

155
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,300
He's got to lower the bid, right?

156
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,500
So he lowers the bid.

157
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,340
And he may have to lower the bid down to $92,000 before the auction can get underway.

158
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,020
So all of a sudden, he lowers it to $92,000.

159
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,640
And all of a sudden, the bidding starts.

160
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,780
You got $93,000, I got $94,000, I got $95,000, $97,000.

161
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,780
And sometimes it will tear right back through the original $100,000 level that no one would lift the bid for to begin with.

162
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,760
Now, as the auction progresses, you may hear a couple of things.

163
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,020
As the auction starts to slow down, the auctioneer has to make it feel exciting and really keep your interest, right?

164
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,860
So he starts putting in what is called filler.

165
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,340
So let's say the auction slows down at $105,000.

166
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,280
Who will give $105,000?

167
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,800
And he goes into this elaborate description.

168
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,100
And at that point in time, is the auction over?

169
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,340
No, the auction's not over.

170
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,280
But the auction is slowing down.

171
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,740
You need to, if you really become aware of this, you understand what's going on.

172
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,060
The same thing takes place in the markets.

173
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,880
What happens, what other kind of response might you hear from the auctioneer?

174
00:14:50,880 --> 00:15:00,580
Let's say you're up to $105,000, and, you know, you've done your homework, and you're pretty smug, and you think it's certainly not worth $105,000.

175
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,820
But at $105,000, all of a sudden, you hear the auctioneer say, new bidder.

176
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,880
Well, are higher prices cutting off activity, or are higher prices bringing in more bids and more activity?

177
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:22,380
When you hear the auctioneer say, new bidder, higher prices are bringing in more activity, not cutting off the activity.

178
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,040
Guess what?

179
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,240
It doesn't make any difference what you think that value is.

180
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,360
That auction's not completed.

181
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,360
How many times in a market have you seen price go down, whether it's a stock or whether it's a future?

182
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:46,340
You will see price go down, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the price reverses and is going the other way.

183
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,400
And you start to see that higher prices, instead of cutting off activity, bring in more and more activity.

184
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:04,720
So one of the things that you really start to need to understand and appreciate is this whole idea of the auction process.

185
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,580
This is how markets operate.

186
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,200
The first example we talked about was a very simple example.

187
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,720
It's a very expensive art auction.

188
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,720
One item to be auctioned.

189
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Okay?

190
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,800
Let's go and talk about where horses are being auctioned.

191
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,080
Okay?

192
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,640
Horses are being auctioned.

193
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,880
It may not be, there may be multiple, you know, horses or livestock available for auction.

194
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:41,240
Now, the same process as the auction gets underway, some people are getting their demand fulfilled, right?

195
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,920
So they're dropping by the wayside, and this auction continues, and the auction continues up until what?

196
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,880
Until the demand has been filled or everybody has stepped aside.

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,700
So we go up until the last bitter bid.

198
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,020
And that's when the auction is completed.

199
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,080
Now, think about this.

200
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,640
If the auction was completed successfully, and I now walk out and I say,

201
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,580
Oh, by the way, I have one more of the same thing to auction.

202
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,280
If the auction had been successful, and let's say that this item went for, pick a number, $150,000.

203
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,340
If the auction was successful, I say, Oh, by the way, I have one more.

204
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,800
Probably shouldn't get any more than $120,000, $125,000, because the auction ought to go up,

205
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,840
and it ought to drop away from it very quickly once it's completed.

206
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,480
So this is kind of the auction process.

207
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,060
Extremely important in understanding how markets operate.

208
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Now, the difference between the art auction or the auction for livestock or multiple items

209
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:58,120
is that in the stock market, we continually, or futures market, we continually auction from low to high and from high to low.

210
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,980
So that ongoing auction process is continuous in there.

211
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:13,460
If you go to the art auction, for example, you have all types of people that are participating, right?

212
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,360
And this becomes very important also.

213
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,120
You may have a dealer that is at one of the auctions.

214
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,420
It could be the art auction, or it can be in the auction for livestock.

215
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,320
You may have a dealer that's trying to get inventory for his business, and then he's going to do what?

216
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,320
Resell it.

217
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,660
So that would be one motivation.

218
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,700
You may have a collector, right?

219
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,180
You may have a collector, and he wants that for his own personal collection.

220
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,600
Maybe it's a legacy thing, or maybe it's an ego type of thing.

221
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,020
The motivations go on and on.

222
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:58,340
We talk a lot about, in this time frame, motivation and why, who are the buyers and sellers in these auctions.

223
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:11,000
In the stock and futures market, we auction from low to high and then from high to low in this continual search for information.

224
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,080
When the market auctions too high, at that point in time, you start to feel that it was too much.

225
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:30,680
Once it gets too high, then the process starts in the opposite direction, and we start auctioning lower, looking to attract what?

226
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,540
If we start auctioning lower, we are searching for what?

227
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:39,880
Now, for buyers, right, as we're auctioning higher, we're looking for sellers.

228
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:53,460
So in this process, this up-and-down two-way auction process is generated a tremendous amount of information, and it's that kind of information that we want to capture.

229
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,460
Okay, let's take a look at this process.

230
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,860
Right here, all this is, and we haven't explained it yet, but this is a market profile.

231
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:11,580
In the one on the left, on this profile, and we've split it out, your first auction is going from high to low, right?

232
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,480
So the market started high, it auctioned lower.

233
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,440
Down here, it finally got low enough.

234
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,680
When you auction lower, you're looking for what?

235
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,860
You're looking for buyers.

236
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,860
You got low enough to find buyers, and now you start auctioning in the other direction.

237
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,640
When you auction in the other direction, you're looking for what?

238
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,680
You're looking for sellers.

239
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,700
It's that two-way auction process.

240
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:48,620
What you're going to find is we use the market profile in order to record the net effect of that two-way auction process.

241
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,120
So this is what it looks like when it's completed.

242
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,020
This is what it looks like when it's spread out.

243
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,220
And I just put it this way so you can see the auction going lower, looking for buyers, the auction going higher, looking for sellers.

244
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,140
And you can see that there is, if you had a bar chart, you'd never see this, right?

245
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,500
We talked earlier about a bar chart, one dimension.

246
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,040
All we've done is added another dimension.

247
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,820
We're going to show you how this is constructed in just a moment.

248
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:23,700
Okay, the following graphic represents a normal distribution curve.

249
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:34,420
Scientists for years have employed a distribution curve in order to organize the data.

250
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,440
They employ the curve to organize data and then so they can study the data.

251
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,800
That's the purpose of it.

252
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,460
It's a scientific approach to understanding data.

253
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,240
All we've done, this is what's called a normal or a bell-shaped curve.

254
00:21:50,780 --> 00:22:00,500
Now, I can tell you that it is very rare that you will ever see a normal or bell-shaped curve in the marketplace.

255
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,840
But it's the idea of the distribution.

256
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:12,680
What we do, if we start off and we look at a bell-shaped curve, that would be a market that was perfectly balanced.

257
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:20,080
Now, what we start to observe is how far out of balance the market is in either direction.

258
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,880
When you look at the curve, one standard deviation is going to cover approximately 70%.

259
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,300
They give you an actual number of 68%, but it's going to cover about 70%.

260
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,800
One standard deviation, the fattest part of the curve.

261
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,600
Two standard deviations, about 95% of the curve.

262
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:44,380
When you get into three standard deviations, it's going to cover about 99% of the curve.

263
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,600
Well, you don't need to worry about those numbers.

264
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,120
It is just this idea of how information is distributed.

265
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:05,320
What you're going to find is the market profile graphic really is keyed off of the idea of a normal distribution curve.

266
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,980
It is nothing more than a way to organize data.

267
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,940
Once the data is organized, now you have a way to start to understand what is going on.

268
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,740
And you understand, if you look at a market, and one day you've got maybe 100,000 participants,

269
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,140
the next day you've got 150,000 participants, it's all going to vary.

270
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,760
If you, let me give you a real-life example.

271
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,540
Let's say I have a barbecue in my backyard, and I've invited 30 people to that barbecue.

272
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,800
And I'm looking out, everybody seems to be having fun, and I look out and I say,

273
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Rick, what do you think the average or mean height is of the people at my barbecue?

274
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,360
He looks at me and he says, Jim, how would I know?

275
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,520
All I do is I go out and I take that same data, I take those 30 people, I organize them under a distribution curve.

276
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:07,720
All of a sudden, you start to look at it, he says, oh, well, it looks to me like the average or mean height is maybe it's around 5'7 or 5'8.

277
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,020
Now, let's say we take a picture, we take a picture or a snapshot, a satellite flies over,

278
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,620
takes a picture of those organized people at my barbecue.

279
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,160
Now, some people leave early, right?

280
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,940
Some people come in a little bit later.

281
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,500
Those that leave early have some height, those that come in later have a different height.

282
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,580
Maybe more left than come back in.

283
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,200
So, maybe the following morning or late that night, I go out and I reorganize those people again,

284
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,920
and I take another satellite photo of the people at my barbecue.

285
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,300
All of a sudden, I take one picture, I take the other, and I overlay those two pictures.

286
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,460
They're probably not going to be the same, right?

287
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,120
So, what it's going to allow me to see is some shift that took place in the underlying data.

288
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:09,100
Had I not organized that data, the chances are that I wouldn't have seen or been able to determine

289
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,220
subtle shifts that took place in the people attending that barbecue.

290
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,740
That's what we're after.

291
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,300
We're after the ability to organize data and take that data and start to make some sense out of it.

292
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,160
Okay, let's take a look at how we actually form the market profile graphic.

293
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,600
When, in order to form a distribution curve, you need two things.

294
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,540
You need a variable, and you need a constant.

295
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:52,580
The breakthrough in the ability to organize the data was the discovery by an individual by the name of Pete Stonelmeyer.

296
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,520
It was majored in statistics at Stanford.

297
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,760
The breakthrough was that you can make time the constant.

298
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,820
So, this time between 11 and 11.30 is the same as the time between 12 and 12.30.

299
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,220
One day is as long as the next day, one week as long as the next week, etc.

300
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,380
So, you make time the constant.

301
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,080
Time the constant forms your horizontal axis.

302
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,280
If you then take price, which is a variable, and plot price the variable against time the constant,

303
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,600
you have the makings of formulating a distribution curve in order to organize the data that we're going to be talking about.

304
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:47,700
When Pete came up to talk to me some years back, we had been talking for probably less than four minutes.

305
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,540
When Pete threw out the idea of time as a constant, I knew immediately what he had been discovered.

306
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,000
I had been trying to find a way to organize the data.

307
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,800
I actually had some things on my desk that looked like distribution curves.

308
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,240
At that point in time, I was trying to figure out, you know, how to do certain option strategies.

309
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,360
But I knew immediately, I knew my stuff didn't work like it should.

310
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,520
I knew that Pete had something when he came in the idea of time as the constant.

311
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,080
We talked for another 15 or 20 minutes.

312
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,680
Pete walked out to the elevator, walked back in, and he looked at me and said,

313
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,660
Would you like to sponsor my first book?

314
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,900
The name of the first book that introduced this information was called Markets and Market Logic.

315
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,500
And I said yes, and on the spot, I wrote him out a check for $10,000.

316
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,840
If you ever look at the first book, right across the front, it said sponsored by J. Abdul.

317
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,380
But I knew the value of the idea of making time the constant.

318
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,480
So many great discoveries are far simpler than we would ever imagine.

319
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,200
So time the constant versus price the variable allows us to form the distribution curve.

320
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,680
If you take, there's a profile, all it is, you start to visualize,

321
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,540
it's nothing more than the distribution curve we looked at earlier turned on its side.

322
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,940
That's how we organize the data.

323
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,360
Now, that's what a market profile looks like.

324
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,940
If you look, if you think about this, if you have a bar chart,

325
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,480
and we already said a bar chart has four data points, right?

326
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,840
Open, high, low, close.

327
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:43,360
When you look at a profile that is two-dimensional, it is going to release tremendous amounts of information.

328
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,840
Now, not only do I still have the open, high, low, close on this, right?

329
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,800
But I now get some performance figures.

330
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,140
I can see how much time, the more letters out here, the more time that was spent here,

331
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,160
I start to get some idea of how much time was spent at each price.

332
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,940
How much time was the auction down here?

333
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,980
It was rejected pretty quickly.

334
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,860
At the top, it was rejected pretty quickly.

335
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,500
So, I get tremendous amounts of information that I didn't have before.

336
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,880
Remember, initially, with one dimension, open, high, low, close, that's really what I was dealing with.

337
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,280
Now, tremendous amounts of information.

338
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,620
That, to some people, is a negative.

339
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,580
Sometimes, if you can't process basic information to begin with,

340
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,120
giving you more information is not necessarily a positive.

341
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,600
You have to really be able to learn to use the information,

342
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,060
which means you're probably going to have to get rid of some other information in order to make room for this.

343
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,740
So, on its surface, while it intuitively may sound good that more information is better,

344
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,180
it is not necessarily true.

345
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,100
You have to use that information very intelligently.

346
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,280
Okay, let's work forward.

347
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:12,100
And we see now, the graphic is just, it's an analogy as to putting the pieces of a puzzle together.

348
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,180
As you go through this, it's piece by piece by piece.

349
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:27,340
I would guess, if you're really pretty sharp, it's going to take you probably a good year,

350
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:34,540
a good year, to start to get a foundation of how all these pieces begin to fit together.

351
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,080
We have a saying, and you'll hear it again, and you'll see a slide on it later,

352
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:46,400
no real learning starts until you can put that information within some contextual view.

353
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Give me an idea.

354
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,980
Most people, it's always amazed me,

355
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,680
I will get a tremendous number of clients that have been very successful in business.

356
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,580
In business, if you raise the price of your product,

357
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,680
and your volume drops off, what do you do?

358
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,520
You're going to lower the price, right?

359
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,580
You raise the price of your product, and the volume drops off,

360
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,260
your market share drops off,

361
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,180
you're going to lower the price to get back your market share.

362
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,620
Those that have been in business,

363
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,000
if you raised your price too high, and your volume dropped off,

364
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,980
are you going to get your market share back by just going back to the original price?

365
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,140
Probably not, right?

366
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,960
You're probably going to have to lower it below where you were initially,

367
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,880
in order to get your market share back, and get your business back.

368
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,280
Now, sometimes we can see that by actually lowering the price,

369
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,080
or we can offer discounts.

370
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,440
You know, 0% financing, $500 cash back,

371
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,840
there's all kind of ways in order to adjust the price,

372
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,400
in order to get the demand that you want.

373
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,060
That same kind of thing takes place in a market.

374
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,240
So, let's talk about this idea of context.

375
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,420
Many people, when they come out of business,

376
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,220
they understand context tremendously.

377
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,980
They understand price, they understand volume,

378
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,740
yet they will turn around and start to trade stocks and futures,

379
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,640
and they will focus mainly on price.

380
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
They don't pay attention to volume.

381
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,240
If I raise my price and my volume drops off by 20%,

382
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,760
guess what?

383
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,060
In business, I know immediately that's not very healthy.

384
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,660
The structure of what I've done with that price isn't going to last very long.

385
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,340
Does that mean I won't sell anything?

386
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,620
No, I'll sell something, but it's not going to be the same thing.

387
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,520
Or, if I raise my price, if I raise the price,

388
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,840
and I actually do the same or more volume,

389
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,720
does that give me information?

390
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,480
That gives me a whole entirely different context.

391
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:06,120
The best example that I can think of is years ago,

392
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,000
I used to be amazed.

393
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,480
You'd watch the interest, you'd watch interest rates.

394
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,560
And if interest rates were coming down,

395
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,020
all of a sudden, people would be looking and say,

396
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,780
well, I'm not going to buy the house right now

397
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,940
because I think rates are going lower.

398
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,320
So, you know, it's going lower and lower,

399
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,320
and all of a sudden, finally, the Fed tightens the rates

400
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,200
and the rates start to go higher.

401
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,820
Well, theoretically, as the rates go higher,

402
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,180
theoretically, that should cut off the activity, right?

403
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,880
But, in fact, if you're coming from this low level,

404
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,260
when you raise the rates, does that cut off the activity?

405
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,560
No, they come clamoring into the market

406
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,960
because they're afraid that the rates

407
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,240
are now going the other way.

408
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,660
So higher prices bring in even more activity

409
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,700
because people are afraid they're going to miss the market.

410
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,920
Now, think about this in the stocks and futures market.

411
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,060
The price goes down and goes down,

412
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,320
and you're not going to buy, right?

413
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,380
You're not going to buy.

414
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,420
The market's going down because it's going lower, right?

415
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,980
All of a sudden, it starts the other way,

416
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,480
and you start paying more and more and more.

417
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,680
Or something you could have bought for $7 yesterday,

418
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,160
you're willing to pay $9, $10, and $11 for today

419
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,660
because you're caught in this auction process

420
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,780
and you want to make sure you don't miss it.

421
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,000
That's all part of the contextual view.

422
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,020
So I want you to think about those things,

423
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,460
those pieces of the puzzle.

424
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,400
Now, let's, for those that are new to this process,

425
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,200
let's talk about the construction of a market profile.

426
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,380
First of all, each letter,

427
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,120
and you'll see how the letters are formed in a minute,

428
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,800
each letter is called a time price opportunity, TPO.

429
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,500
It is just simply a way to record the data.

430
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,600
It means nothing more than that.

431
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,540
It doesn't make any difference if it's an A, a B, or a C.

432
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,480
Okay, let's take a look at the next step

433
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,180
in how we start to put this together.

434
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,060
Initializing the initial balance,

435
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,780
or when we put this together,

436
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,080
on each, the way we have done it here,

437
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,420
is each period is in 30 minutes.

438
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,900
So, for example, if a market, the S&Ps,

439
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,920
open at, I believe it's 8.30, we're in Chicago,

440
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,060
I think they open at 8.30, Chicago time.

441
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,140
So, for the first half hour of trading,

442
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,720
we might use the letter A.

443
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,900
So, that would, so, every time it trades at a given price,

444
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,300
we just put a letter to show that we traded at that price.

445
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,860
The second period would be B.

446
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
All we're doing is recording

447
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,820
every time the second period trades at a price.

448
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,920
Then you've got C, et cetera.

449
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,880
So, it goes on.

450
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,680
So, we traded at this price in only one 30-minute period.

451
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,020
We traded at this price in three 30-minute periods.

452
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,880
And this is the profile, how it starts to form.

453
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,500
Or, if you think of our puzzle,

454
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,960
it starts to put the left edge to the profile.

455
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,520
And then you'll see that the dimensions,

456
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,800
or the dynamics, move to the right.

457
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,500
Okay, the structure, this is what we refer to

458
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,800
as the structure of the market.

459
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,800
As we record this information,

460
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,400
we start to see the structure forming in the marketplace.

461
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,540
For example, we talked about the auction process to begin with.

462
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,020
If we traded down here, this was the second period low,

463
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,060
and the low of the third period, C period, was up there.

464
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,760
What happened when prices were going lower,

465
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
you're advertising for what?

466
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,140
You're advertising for buyers, right?

467
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Did they find buyers?

468
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,740
They found buyers down there,

469
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
and they were fairly aggressive,

470
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,680
because the next period, that's the lowest price trade.

471
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,620
You now have some type of information about the marketplace.

472
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,720
You auctioned low enough.

473
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,200
You got the expected return,

474
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,600
and the expected return was to find buyers.

475
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,920
Now, the auction, here's the auction,

476
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,960
and now you see the auction starts in the opposite direction.

477
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,540
So it tried to go lower.

478
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,100
That auction, we said it's a two-way auction process.

479
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,560
It tried to go lower.

480
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,040
It got the expected response.

481
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,840
The expected response when you go lower

482
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,460
is to find buyers.

483
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,660
It found the buyers.

484
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,900
Now, the market's going higher,

485
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,240
and as the market's going higher,

486
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,980
it's advertising for what?

487
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,980
It's advertising for sellers, right?

488
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,740
And it goes up until it can find those sellers.

489
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,400
That's just, we're going to continue to work on this,

490
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,840
but that's just kind of the process.

491
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,180
I want you to relate it.

492
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,940
I want you to relate it to the auction process.

493
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,500
Think about the two-way auction process,

494
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,300
and start thinking about,

495
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,360
we organize data in order to gather what?

496
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,640
When we organize the data,

497
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,880
what do we want from that data?

498
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,620
Information, right?

499
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:26,000
Now, we call that information market-generated information.

500
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,360
Now, have I found any information right here?

501
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,500
I found information.

502
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,040
I found that there were buyers at that level, right?

503
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,000
And guess what?

504
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,220
It's not somebody's opinion.

505
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,400
It's not somebody on the news telling you anything.

506
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,800
This is real.

507
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,620
This happens with real people,

508
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,060
with real money,

509
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,940
and that's what we're recording.

510
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,860
It's not somebody's view on the tube or a talking head.

511
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,140
This is supported by real money, real activity.

512
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,620
Now, as we go on,

513
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,540
we're going to want to know how much volume was here,

514
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,940
how aggressive it was.

515
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,060
Let me just ask you a business question.

516
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,660
If, in fact,

517
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,940
this low price down here was a good price,

518
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,020
how long should that price have been there?

519
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,900
Momentarily, right?

520
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Now, let's say we get down here,

521
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,940
and if it's only there momentarily,

522
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,500
how much volume should there be?

523
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,640
Very little.

524
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
It ought to move away from there very quickly.

525
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,360
All of a sudden, I get a lot of volume.

526
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,340
It's there a long time.

527
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,500
You have a whole different context.

528
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,940
Okay, let's continue on

529
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,820
and to see how this develops.

530
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,400
We have, let me go back one slide.

531
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,400
I talk about something in here.

532
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
Initial balance.

533
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,460
Initial balance is really

534
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,860
the first two periods of the day.

535
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,940
Now, it doesn't have to be an exact definition.

536
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:58,820
Okay?

537
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,040
Initial balance is just something we're saying

538
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,120
when the market opens in the morning,

539
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,140
what is really,

540
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,240
how are people seeing the market?

541
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,240
Are they auction a little bit lower?

542
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,200
They find some buyers.

543
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,500
They auction a little bit higher.

544
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,580
They find some sellers.

545
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,280
So, you have a little bit of balance in the morning.

546
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,380
It's not an absolute type of thing.

547
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,360
It doesn't have to actually be two periods.

548
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,880
It is just to give you a foundation.

549
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,620
Once you have that initial balance,

550
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,060
then what you want to see is,

551
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,940
as the day goes on,

552
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,940
are you getting outside of that range?

553
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,180
So, if your initial balance,

554
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,120
let's say, for example,

555
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,000
was from 1 to 10,

556
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,600
and then as the day goes on,

557
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,600
you start trading at 11, 12, 13, 14.

558
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,400
So, you're going beyond the initial balance.

559
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,380
You're extending that range.

560
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,300
And who's extending the range?

561
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,380
Is it buyers or sellers?

562
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,660
It's going to be buyers

563
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,900
that are extending that range to the upside.

564
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,080
So, again, it releases more information

565
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,300
about what's going on in the market.

566
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:04,940
Okay.

567
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,280
Let's take a look.

568
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,140
And this is what we would call range extension.

569
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,600
So, we have the first two periods,

570
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,300
A, B, in this example.

571
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,880
So, the first two periods would be our initial balance.

572
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,320
Now, the market extends down in C period.

573
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,900
When it extends down in C period,

574
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,780
okay, it found,

575
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,820
as we talked already,

576
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,660
it found what?

577
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,800
It found buyers.

578
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,140
Now, once we find the buyers there,

579
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,160
the market starts to trade back up.

580
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,900
When it starts to trade back up again,

581
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,740
now it's going to start searching

582
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,160
for the other end of that initial balance.

583
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,420
Does it have to get there?

584
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,040
No.

585
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,360
But it's get this idea

586
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,080
of the flow of the auction process.

587
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:55,940
Okay.

588
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,500
Let's kind of move on.

589
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,960
We've just talked, again,

590
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,160
another piece of the anatomy

591
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,480
or the description

592
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,940
would be called a buying tail.

593
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:09,760
Okay.

594
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,560
A buying tail is nothing more

595
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,240
than a way to say

596
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,040
that the buyers were what?

597
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,620
Aggressive?

598
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,900
They were very aggressive

599
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,880
at that level.

600
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,020
So,

601
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,060
a two-tick buying tail,

602
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,220
three-tick timetail,

603
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,340
four-tick buying tail,

604
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,700
all is a different measure

605
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,460
of how aggressive,

606
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,720
how aggressive the buyers were

607
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,820
at that particular level.

608
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,420
Again,

609
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,900
that's information.

610
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,080
Now,

611
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,240
let me stop for a second.

612
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,680
What happens

613
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,260
when people are first

614
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,980
looking at this information?

615
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,220
They want to run out

616
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,440
almost immediately

617
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,020
and look for a stock

618
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,800
or a future

619
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,420
that has a buying tail.

620
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,880
Oh, boy.

621
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,160
I mean,

622
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,040
I did this.

623
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,280
When I first started

624
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,140
to learn about this,

625
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,280
I would go out

626
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,340
and I would look for something,

627
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,020
a buying tail.

628
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,240
Oh,

629
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,120
I've got aggressive

630
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,380
buying in there.

631
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,060
And if I didn't have

632
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,740
a buying tail

633
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,780
and I found myself

634
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,160
unwilling to buy

635
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,140
because I didn't have

636
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,440
the sign of the aggressiveness

637
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,860
of that.

638
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
This is one data point.

639
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,100
It is one piece

640
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,760
of information.

641
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,760
It is not in context.

642
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,520
Let me,

643
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,160
we're very early

644
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,980
in this process,

645
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,500
but let me complicate this.

646
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,160
What does it mean

647
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,180
if there is no buying tail?

648
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,580
Okay?

649
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,080
It may mean several things.

650
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,920
And this is when we talk about

651
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,840
it takes time

652
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,040
to understand

653
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,980
this information

654
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,080
and to be able

655
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,560
to use it effectively.

656
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,620
Sometimes,

657
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,120
if a market is too short,

658
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,320
we've heard,

659
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,020
we've all heard

660
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,500
the phase,

661
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,080
the phase,

662
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,160
that a market

663
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,860
is too short

664
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,400
to go any lower

665
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,240
or too long

666
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,140
to go any higher.

667
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,040
Sometimes,

668
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,040
there's so many people

669
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,220
that are short the market,

670
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,860
that have sold the market short,

671
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,920
that every time

672
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,820
the market goes down,

673
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,300
they're buying

674
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,140
to cover their short.

675
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,560
So the market may be weak,

676
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,440
but it may have to rally

677
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,060
before it can break

678
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,540
because you have to get

679
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,820
some of that inventory.

680
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,880
When markets are too short,

681
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,920
it's nothing different.

682
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,060
If you think about a business,

683
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,460
it's nothing different

684
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,080
than saying

685
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,300
that a merchant

686
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,640
has too much inventory.

687
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,460
In this case,

688
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,440
the traders have

689
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,080
too much short inventory.

690
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,860
And that inventory

691
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,180
has to be balanced.

692
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,220
The same thing

693
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,940
on the upper end,

694
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,000
sometimes we say

695
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,200
a market has to break

696
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,320
before it can rally.

697
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,200
Sometimes,

698
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:41,860
it's because

699
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,880
there's too much

700
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,080
long inventory up there.

701
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,240
Too many people

702
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,260
nervous

703
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:47,840
and they're looking

704
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,980
for places to sell

705
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,760
or at the bottom

706
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,040
looking for places

707
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,440
to cover their short.

708
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,960
That's inventory.

709
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,860
Every trader's

710
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,400
got an inventory.

711
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,420
You can come in

712
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:56,840
in the morning

713
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,160
with zero position,

714
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,280
you have zero inventory.

715
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,040
You short a contract,

716
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,060
you short one.

717
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,660
You buy one,

718
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,520
you long one.

719
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,500
That's your inventory.

720
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,980
You start taking

721
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,420
that in total

722
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,520
around the world

723
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,660
and all of a sudden

724
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,660
you can get

725
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,420
huge inventory imbalances.

726
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:12,740
So,

727
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,720
one of the things

728
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,760
you'll learn later on

729
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,380
and comes with

730
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,900
cumulative experience

731
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,040
is you find out

732
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,160
there's also information

733
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,660
in when there is

734
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,440
no buying tail.

735
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,100
Anyhow,

736
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:24,900
we're not here

737
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,980
to talk about that now.

738
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,760
All I'm trying

739
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,820
to warn you against

740
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,680
right now

741
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,740
is that

742
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,700
it is not as simple

743
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,640
as it looks.

744
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,400
I think about the time

745
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,600
when I was in the service

746
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,340
and the first class

747
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,260
we had on

748
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,860
hand-to-hand combat

749
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,600
and martial arts

750
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,500
and things like that

751
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
and I remember

752
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,460
the Sergeant Montgomery

753
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:46,840
saying,

754
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,020
gentlemen,

755
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,020
let me warn you,

756
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:49,800
you know,

757
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,300
if you go out

758
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,040
in the bars tonight,

759
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,140
you don't know enough

760
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,700
to really put this to use.

761
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,240
Of course,

762
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,160
we were fast learners,

763
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,440
right?

764
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,600
So we go out

765
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,300
the first night

766
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,740
we're down in

767
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,080
one of the Navy SEAL areas

768
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,800
down in

769
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,100
the southern part

770
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,640
of the country

771
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,660
and we got

772
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,180
Wise Marken

773
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:08,660
in a bar

774
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,920
and guess what?

775
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,720
We learned very quickly

776
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,860
we did not have

777
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,900
enough information

778
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,960
at that point in time

779
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,920
to compete

780
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
with some of the Navy SEALs.

781
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,720
I did come out alive

782
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,880
but it was not

783
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,420
that pleasant

784
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,140
to experience.

785
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,580
I had some

786
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,100
unpleasant experiences

787
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,720
here early on.

788
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,120
Okay?

789
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,140
Let's move on.

790
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,620
Okay?

791
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,740
We talked earlier

792
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,220
about a buying tail.

793
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,300
Now,

794
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:32,920
we come up

795
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,380
and we talk

796
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,240
about a selling tail.

797
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,180
It's just the

798
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,980
mirror image.

799
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,320
Again,

800
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,360
it's information.

801
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,900
The longer the tail,

802
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,320
the more aggressive

803
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,080
the sellers were

804
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,220
at that point in time.

805
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,460
That is a very

806
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,620
valuable type

807
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,040
of information.

808
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,660
And as you can see,

809
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,840
as the day develops,

810
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,420
you continue to get

811
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,440
dimension to the profile.

812
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:57,980
Okay?

813
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:58,900
Let's continue

814
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,940
to look at the anatomy.

815
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,700
Down here,

816
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,580
picture before

817
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,460
we had the C period.

818
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:07,960
Down here,

819
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,700
we circled this

820
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,180
so you were right here.

821
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,240
When you don't have

822
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,740
the buying or selling tails,

823
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,120
what we're saying

824
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,940
is the puzzle

825
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,000
at this point

826
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,460
is not yet completed.

827
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,340
very key piece

828
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,880
of information.

829
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:24,540
For example,

830
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,480
you will see some days

831
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,680
where you'll get right there

832
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
and you have ABC.

833
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,300
The market will rally

834
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,840
from that level.

835
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:34,460
And let's,

836
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,040
a lot of times,

837
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,220
this may turn out

838
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,540
to be a previous day's

839
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,220
high or low.

840
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,760
A very mechanical point

841
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,280
that traders

842
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,840
can very easily see.

843
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,500
So you'll see the market

844
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,520
rally from here.

845
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,460
What it does,

846
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,740
it changes the odds

847
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,800
of the market

848
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,920
going higher.

849
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,180
It may bounce

850
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:52,540
from there.

851
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,360
You may get some short

852
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,160
covering from there.

853
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,600
You may get some traders

854
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,000
mechanically buying

855
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,900
at a previous

856
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,820
morning low

857
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,180
or daily low.

858
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,780
But the fact

859
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,460
that the auction

860
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,080
is not complete here

861
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,000
lowers the odds

862
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,100
of your success

863
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,920
to the upside.

864
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,580
Very often,

865
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,180
what you'll see

866
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:09,900
is not completed.

867
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,780
You'll see it bounce.

868
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:11,820
Then you'll see it

869
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,080
come back a second time

870
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,700
and actually complete

871
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,260
that auction process.

872
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,460
Again,

873
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,340
it's going to get

874
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,260
more complicated.

875
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,560
But it's just

876
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,340
a piece of information.

877
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,620
But it helps

878
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,620
as we go through this.

879
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,540
It helps compute

880
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,300
the odds

881
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,760
of being long,

882
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,800
being short.

883
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,200
Trading is about,

884
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,160
trading is about

885
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,180
understanding the odds.

886
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,860
Most people

887
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,300
have no idea

888
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,460
when they're trading

889
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,260
what the odds

890
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,280
they're dealing with are.

891
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,080
All they want to do

892
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,100
is they're so

893
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,880
emotionally involved

894
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,860
they just want to

895
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,720
buy something lower,

896
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,460
sell it higher.

897
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,560
They have no idea

898
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,120
that the risk

899
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,520
they're taking.

900
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,400
The other day

901
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,900
when the market

902
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,260
dropped, you know,

903
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,160
a thousand points

904
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,820
at one time,

905
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,040
we were talking

906
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,240
about poor structure

907
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,220
going up.

908
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,460
Most of the people

909
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,420
had no idea

910
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,140
the risk that they had

911
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,320
by being long

912
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,920
the market.

913
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,100
When you look

914
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:05,920
underneath the market,

915
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,000
there was weakness

916
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,780
in the structure.

917
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,400
Would I have

918
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,100
predicted that?

919
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,760
No, I wouldn't

920
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,520
have predicted that

921
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,100
because it was

922
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,880
far beyond

923
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,540
three, four, five.

924
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,160
It was probably

925
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,560
an uncalculable event.

926
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:18,980
It was probably

927
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,480
a 50 standard

928
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,780
deviation move

929
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,900
when you had

930
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,720
a break like that

931
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,340
which may be

932
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,100
equivalent to

933
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,680
the odds of that

934
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,760
happening in our lifetime

935
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,260
are probably,

936
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:28,800
you know,

937
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,480
minuscule.

938
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,540
but the odds

939
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,120
of having

940
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,060
something bad

941
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,720
happen were

942
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,740
much greater

943
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,800
because of the fact

944
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,620
of the underlying

945
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,220
structure

946
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,180
and we'll continue

947
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,880
to come back

948
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,220
to that.

949
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,420
Okay, let's look

950
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,320
at more pieces

951
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,360
that go into

952
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,440
the puzzle.

953
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,520
I talked earlier

954
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,040
about the point

955
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,620
of control

956
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,980
and this will be

957
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,440
a very important

958
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,480
concept for you

959
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,240
to deal with

960
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,820
as we go

961
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,320
through this.

962
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,060
Technically speaking,

963
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,360
when you look

964
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,960
at the market

965
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,640
profile,

966
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,340
the point of control

967
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,820
is the longest

968
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,560
line reading

969
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,880
from left to right

970
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,940
of the daily

971
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,640
profile.

972
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,200
It's the longest

973
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,820
line means

974
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,100
it traded there

975
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,720
in the greatest

976
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,560
number of half

977
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,020
hour periods.

978
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,460
Incidentally,

979
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,460
we use 30 minute

980
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,120
periods to construct

981
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,240
the market profile.

982
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,680
That's on when

983
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,360
you go across

984
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,380
the horizontal line

985
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,900
in the bottom.

986
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,220
The first period

987
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,140
would be 30 minutes

988
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,480
so if a market

989
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,640
opened at 9.30

990
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,680
the first period

991
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,580
would be 9.30

992
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,040
to 10.

993
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,720
The second period

994
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,000
would be 10

995
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,700
to 10.30.

996
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,500
It doesn't make

997
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,280
any difference.

998
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:37,920
You can use

999
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,820
5 minutes,

1000
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,960
15 minutes,

1001
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:40,640
an hour.

1002
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,920
You can do it

1003
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,500
with a day.

1004
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,060
You can have

1005
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:43,680
each period

1006
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,420
being a day.

1007
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,260
It doesn't make

1008
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,060
any difference.

1009
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,860
One of the

1010
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,780
important points

1011
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,260
that I want

1012
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:50,820
to make here,

1013
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,380
when you go

1014
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,200
through this,

1015
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,860
the concepts

1016
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,640
that we are

1017
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,320
talking about,

1018
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,940
the organization

1019
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,840
of the data,

1020
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,640
the way the market

1021
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,020
works,

1022
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,980
if it doesn't

1023
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,840
work for all

1024
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,340
time frames,

1025
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:02,900
and we haven't

1026
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,740
really introduced

1027
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,680
the time frames yet,

1028
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,560
but you can

1029
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,340
quickly understand

1030
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,840
that there's

1031
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,640
people with

1032
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,240
very short

1033
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,760
time frames

1034
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,160
and people

1035
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:09,980
with very long

1036
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,560
time frames,

1037
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:11,820
day traders,

1038
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,040
people that are

1039
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,460
going to buy

1040
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:13,900
for months.

1041
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,080
The concepts

1042
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,260
are exactly

1043
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,100
the same,

1044
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:17,840
whether it's

1045
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,440
5 minute,

1046
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,880
5 minute time frame,

1047
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,960
30 minute time frame,

1048
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,960
daily time frame,

1049
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,340
all markets

1050
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,680
that are

1051
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,480
financial in

1052
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,880
nature should

1053
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,900
operate in

1054
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,720
exactly the

1055
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,640
same manner.

1056
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,700
We'll talk

1057
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,320
about that

1058
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,100
more as we

1059
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,340
go.

1060
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:33,860
The first

1061
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,720
we had was

1062
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,220
the point of

1063
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:35,660
control.

1064
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:36,680
It's the

1065
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,640
longest line,

1066
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,240
closest to the

1067
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,800
center of the

1068
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,060
range.

1069
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,500
That's the

1070
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,020
technical

1071
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,660
definition.

1072
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,260
But what I

1073
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,980
want you to

1074
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,900
really appreciate

1075
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,420
more than

1076
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,260
anything else,

1077
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,740
it is the

1078
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,000
fairest price

1079
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,400
at which

1080
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,300
business is

1081
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,100
being conducted.

1082
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,040
If I'm

1083
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,700
looking at

1084
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,460
a graphic,

1085
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,360
a profile

1086
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,620
graphic for

1087
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,340
a particular

1088
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,800
day,

1089
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,280
the longest

1090
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,360
line closest

1091
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:00,800
to the

1092
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,200
center of

1093
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,640
the range

1094
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,740
is the

1095
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,540
fairest price

1096
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:03,880
at which

1097
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,520
business is

1098
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,260
being conducted

1099
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,340
for that

1100
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,860
particular day.

1101
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,780
That is

1102
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,420
extremely

1103
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,140
valuable

1104
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:10,900
information.

1105
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,560
As you

1106
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,040
see,

1107
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,600
price move

1108
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,500
away from

1109
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:15,960
the fairest

1110
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,280
price to

1111
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,840
the downside

1112
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,480
or move

1113
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,140
away from

1114
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,340
it on

1115
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,880
the upside,

1116
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:21,940
let's add

1117
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,740
some context.

1118
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,280
If the

1119
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:23,940
fairest price

1120
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,620
is moved

1121
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,380
right here

1122
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,440
and now

1123
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,300
you see

1124
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,320
price start

1125
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,920
to auction

1126
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,400
higher to

1127
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,880
get away

1128
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,280
from the

1129
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:31,980
fairest price,

1130
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,980
what would

1131
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,600
it take

1132
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,740
to change

1133
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,400
the fairest

1134
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:36,760
price?

1135
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:38,980
This is

1136
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,480
formed by

1137
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:39,840
time,

1138
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,080
right?

1139
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,880
So if I

1140
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,700
spent five

1141
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,560
periods here

1142
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,760
in the

1143
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,060
middle and

1144
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:44,580
then four

1145
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:44,860
at the

1146
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,420
next price,

1147
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,340
it would

1148
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,100
take time

1149
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,680
in order to

1150
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,380
raise or

1151
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,360
lower the

1152
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:49,940
fairest price

1153
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,480
to conduct

1154
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:50,880
business.

1155
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,720
But if I

1156
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,260
start to

1157
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,900
move away

1158
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,380
from the

1159
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,280
fairest price,

1160
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,900
or another

1161
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,300
way to say

1162
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,660
I have

1163
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,580
price moving

1164
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,180
above value

1165
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,780
or above

1166
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,240
the fairest

1167
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,520
price,

1168
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,680
and let's

1169
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,160
say it's

1170
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:03,660
on low

1171
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,040
volume.

1172
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:04,940
If I

1173
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,480
move away

1174
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:05,800
from the

1175
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,320
fairest price

1176
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:06,580
to do

1177
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:06,900
business

1178
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,740
on low

1179
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,140
volume,

1180
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,020
what do

1181
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,340
you think

1182
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:09,860
the odds

1183
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,000
are that

1184
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,420
that price

1185
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,200
change is

1186
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:13,500
going to

1187
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,260
be maintained?

1188
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,280
If I

1189
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,840
moved away

1190
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,720
on lower

1191
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,140
volume,

1192
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,200
not very

1193
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,480
good,

1194
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:19,720
right?

1195
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,500
No

1196
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,020
different

1197
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,580
than a

1198
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:21,860
merchant

1199
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,300
or a

1200
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:22,940
manufacturer

1201
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,540
raising the

1202
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,020
price of

1203
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,460
a product

1204
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:25,880
that they're

1205
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,220
offering

1206
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,240
and having

1207
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,960
the volume

1208
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,560
dry up.

1209
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,460
The chances

1210
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,280
are you're

1211
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,680
going to get

1212
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,120
regression

1213
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,920
back to

1214
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,240
the mean.

1215
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,420
The same

1216
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,320
thing if

1217
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,100
price goes

1218
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,160
lower and

1219
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,760
the volume

1220
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,460
dries up

1221
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,200
or diminishes,

1222
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,160
the chances

1223
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:39,680
are you're

1224
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,040
going to get

1225
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:40,800
pulled back.

1226
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:41,860
Now,

1227
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,720
let's talk

1228
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,120
about a

1229
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,380
different

1230
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:43,940
scenario.

1231
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,600
My

1232
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,000
fairest

1233
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,420
price to

1234
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:45,520
do

1235
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:45,840
business

1236
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,400
here and

1237
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:46,820
then price

1238
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,440
moves higher.

1239
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,260
As it

1240
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,880
moves higher,

1241
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:49,920
that's going

1242
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,940
on increased

1243
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,400
volume.

1244
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,160
What do

1245
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:52,460
you think

1246
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,020
the chances

1247
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,080
are now?

1248
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:54,380
You see how

1249
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,840
the odds

1250
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,260
change?

1251
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,020
It may

1252
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,440
get pulled

1253
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,860
back to

1254
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,020
this,

1255
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:57,380
but the

1256
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,140
odds have

1257
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,600
lessened.

1258
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:58,940
If I'm

1259
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,560
moving higher

1260
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,440
away from

1261
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:00,860
the fairest

1262
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,500
price on

1263
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,460
solid volume,

1264
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,500
the odds

1265
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,300
are less

1266
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:04,940
that I'm

1267
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,400
going to

1268
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:05,840
regress

1269
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,540
back to

1270
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,120
this level.

1271
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,040
Again,

1272
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,140
this is all

1273
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,780
part of the

1274
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,880
context and

1275
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,480
we'll continue

1276
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,620
to work on

1277
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:12,860
this.

1278
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,640
The point

1279
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,320
of control

1280
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,640
or the

1281
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,040
fairest

1282
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,600
price to

1283
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,780
do

1284
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,240
business

1285
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,960
will

1286
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,780
migrate

1287
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,980
up or

1288
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,540
down

1289
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,440
throughout

1290
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,060
the day.

1291
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,360
As you

1292
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,640
look at

1293
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,260
the profile,

1294
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:25,640
you can

1295
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,080
see another

1296
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,600
way to

1297
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,660
describe the

1298
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,620
market profile,

1299
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:30,800
it is a

1300
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,440
time-sensitive,

1301
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,480
real-time,

1302
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,140
time-sensitive

1303
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,180
evolving

1304
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,960
database.

1305
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,000
It's

1306
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,580
alive,

1307
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:38,980
it's

1308
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,600
dynamic,

1309
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,800
it changes

1310
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,760
throughout the

1311
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,000
day.

1312
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,160
We said

1313
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:43,760
each one

1314
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,020
of those

1315
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,320
letters

1316
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:44,640
is the

1317
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,240
TPOs.

1318
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:45,960
As the

1319
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,600
TPOs

1320
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,060
change,

1321
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:47,540
it's

1322
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,080
dynamic,

1323
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,700
it grows

1324
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,160
with you,

1325
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,020
it grows

1326
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,560
with the

1327
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:50,840
market.

1328
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:51,340
There's

1329
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,000
absolutely

1330
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,800
nothing

1331
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,380
static

1332
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,060
about it.

1333
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,100
The

1334
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,380
migration

1335
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:56,960
of the

1336
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,360
point of

1337
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,920
control

1338
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,200
up or

1339
00:54:59,200 --> 00:54:59,640
down

1340
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,020
throughout

1341
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,440
the day,

1342
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,700
in other

1343
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:00,920
words,

1344
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,500
if the

1345
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,180
fairest

1346
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,740
price to

1347
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,340
conduct

1348
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,900
business

1349
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,140
migrates

1350
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,720
up and

1351
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,040
down

1352
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,380
throughout

1353
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:06,920
the day,

1354
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:07,560
that is

1355
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,080
also

1356
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,160
generating

1357
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,780
very

1358
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,340
valuable

1359
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,060
information.

1360
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,320
If,

1361
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:12,860
in fact,

1362
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,400
you start

1363
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,980
to see

1364
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,620
the

1365
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:14,860
point

1366
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,000
of

1367
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,540
control

1368
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,760
migrating

1369
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,340
lower

1370
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,000
throughout

1371
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,560
the day,

1372
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,880
what is

1373
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,620
causing it

1374
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,500
to migrate

1375
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:21,880
lower?

1376
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,240
Is it

1377
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:22,640
because of

1378
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:22,940
buyers?

1379
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,700
Or is it

1380
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,180
because of

1381
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:25,480
sellers?

1382
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,040
When you're

1383
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,320
on the

1384
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,660
floor of

1385
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,060
exchange,

1386
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:28,640
this means

1387
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,020
buy,

1388
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,880
this means

1389
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,220
sell.

1390
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:30,900
If you

1391
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,860
have a

1392
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,260
point of

1393
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:32,720
control

1394
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,740
migrating

1395
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,120
lower

1396
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,480
throughout

1397
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:34,960
the day,

1398
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,260
that means

1399
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,680
that you

1400
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,060
have

1401
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,160
somebody

1402
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,840
selling

1403
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,460
into the

1404
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:40,680
market.

1405
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:40,940
In other

1406
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,100
words,

1407
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,460
what they're

1408
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:41,820
probably

1409
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,760
doing is

1410
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,640
on every

1411
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,120
rally,

1412
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,600
you probably

1413
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,140
have some

1414
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,640
bigger money

1415
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:46,960
saying,

1416
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:47,880
you bought

1417
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,160
some,

1418
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:49,500
they let

1419
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:49,860
the market

1420
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,160
settle,

1421
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,540
it comes

1422
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,020
up again,

1423
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:51,960
you bought

1424
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,500
some more,

1425
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,420
be very

1426
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:53,840
subtle,

1427
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,640
but all

1428
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,000
of a sudden,

1429
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:55,500
you see

1430
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,100
that fairest

1431
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,560
price at

1432
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,100
which business

1433
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,520
can be

1434
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,060
conducted

1435
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,480
migrating

1436
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,180
lower.

1437
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,060
Then,

1438
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:01,900
all of a

1439
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,140
sudden,

1440
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:02,600
what you'll

1441
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,440
see sometimes

1442
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,200
is you'll

1443
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,860
just see

1444
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,840
the market

1445
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,800
give way

1446
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,480
and you'll

1447
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,020
see a big

1448
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,860
spike to

1449
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,340
the downside

1450
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:09,880
because all

1451
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,340
of a sudden,

1452
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,360
it started

1453
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:11,980
out very

1454
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,380
subtle,

1455
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:12,700
right?

1456
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,220
If you're

1457
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,760
really a

1458
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,580
smart seller

1459
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:16,960
and you've

1460
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,380
got any

1461
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:17,980
size,

1462
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,020
you want

1463
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,840
to disguise

1464
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,040
your intentions

1465
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,200
as much

1466
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:22,720
as you can,

1467
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:22,960
right?

1468
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,660
You really

1469
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:23,940
want to

1470
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,380
disguise it.

1471
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:24,660
You don't

1472
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,000
want the

1473
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,360
world to

1474
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:25,720
know what

1475
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:25,880
you're

1476
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,140
doing.

1477
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:26,940
If you're

1478
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,400
Fidelity

1479
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,260
or Magellan

1480
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,980
or somebody

1481
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,460
in Vesco

1482
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:29,920
or somebody

1483
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,580
like that,

1484
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,520
you don't

1485
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:31,760
want to

1486
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,500
advertise what

1487
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:32,640
you're

1488
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:32,840
doing.

1489
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,220
Matter of

1490
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:33,420
fact,

1491
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,020
it's not

1492
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,080
uncommon for

1493
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,520
these people

1494
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:35,940
to spread

1495
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,440
their orders

1496
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,340
out or do

1497
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:37,900
everything they

1498
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,320
can to

1499
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:38,960
disguise them.

1500
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:39,920
So all

1501
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,400
of a sudden,

1502
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,240
you see this

1503
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:41,600
point of

1504
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,120
control or

1505
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,740
fairest price

1506
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:42,960
to do

1507
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,260
business

1508
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:43,780
migrating

1509
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,100
lower.

1510
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:44,920
All of a

1511
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,000
sudden,

1512
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,400
the world

1513
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,260
wakes up and

1514
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:46,500
they say,

1515
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:46,960
uh-oh,

1516
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,480
we've been

1517
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:48,820
had.

1518
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,920
And then you'll

1519
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,680
start to see

1520
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,180
a very fast

1521
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,180
break in the

1522
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:53,420
market.

1523
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,940
That's kind

1524
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,220
of a

1525
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,620
realization.

1526
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:55,840
One of my

1527
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,800
favorite stories,

1528
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,880
it talked about

1529
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,760
years ago when I

1530
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,260
was on the

1531
00:56:59,260 --> 00:56:59,900
board of trade.

1532
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,180
there used to

1533
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,960
be a guy down

1534
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,980
there, he was

1535
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,300
a hedger for

1536
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:05,840
one of the

1537
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,720
Minneapolis grain

1538
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,180
companies.

1539
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,600
And that was

1540
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,040
so many years

1541
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,620
ago, that was a

1542
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,760
$500 suit, was

1543
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,900
a big deal.

1544
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,200
But he was very

1545
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,900
nicely dressed,

1546
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:16,640
coat was always

1547
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,720
buttoned, and

1548
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,360
he'd be standing

1549
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,160
there, he'd be

1550
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:19,760
standing like

1551
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,920
this, talking to

1552
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,060
somebody, and all

1553
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,660
of a sudden the

1554
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,480
market would move,

1555
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,080
one of the grain

1556
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,400
markets would move

1557
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,100
up or down, and

1558
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,940
he'd very

1559
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,900
politely excuse

1560
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,340
himself, he'd

1561
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,960
walk into the

1562
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,040
crowd, and he'd

1563
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,180
either be selling

1564
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:32,940
or buying.

1565
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,240
Well the crowd

1566
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,980
knew, the folks

1567
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,380
on the floor

1568
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,480
knew he

1569
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,480
represented size,

1570
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,060
and all of a

1571
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,660
sudden the

1572
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,200
market would go

1573
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,940
crazy for a

1574
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,160
while.

1575
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Then he'd walk

1576
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,060
back over,

1577
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,400
put his hands

1578
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,120
back behind his

1579
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,640
back, and he'd

1580
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,180
go back and

1581
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,780
engage in the

1582
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,880
conversation he'd

1583
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,520
been in before.

1584
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,140
Those people,

1585
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:52,880
that happened to

1586
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
be a very visual

1587
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,460
example, but those

1588
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,420
people exist in

1589
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,040
big size.

1590
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,100
They come in,

1591
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,160
they're opportunists,

1592
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,600
they come in when

1593
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,480
markets are at

1594
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,700
attractive levels for

1595
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,920
them, of what they

1596
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,120
want to do.

1597
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,280
And nobody's going

1598
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,120
to tell you that,

1599
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:08,380
right?

1600
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,500
Nobody's going to

1601
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,380
tell you that, but

1602
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,700
as you learn to

1603
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,340
read the data, you

1604
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,120
start to get a

1605
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,520
better sense of what

1606
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,240
is actually

1607
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,080
transpiring in the

1608
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,380
market.

1609
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,000
And that's where

1610
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,220
we use the market

1611
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,160
profile graphic,

1612
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,880
multidimensional, it

1613
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,440
is a time-sensitive

1614
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,280
real-time

1615
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,520
evolving database.

1616
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,520
Okay, so let's

1617
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,440
move on with some

1618
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,840
of our terminology.

1619
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,320
What are we

1620
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,240
looking at next?

1621
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,360
The point of

1622
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,960
control is

1623
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,840
migrating lower,

1624
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,320
and we're looking

1625
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,460
to see as price

1626
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,700
moves lower, it's

1627
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,720
advertising for

1628
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:46,960
what?

1629
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,740
It's advertising

1630
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,780
for buyers,

1631
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,040
right?

1632
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,600
In any business,

1633
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,460
in any business,

1634
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,840
the important thing

1635
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,580
to have happen is

1636
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,640
to find a place

1637
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,340
where what can

1638
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:04,980
take place?

1639
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,160
Two-sided trade?

1640
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,540
I know this

1641
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,760
gentleman works

1642
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,340
for Ford.

1643
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:10,980
In us, there's

1644
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,980
two-sided trade that

1645
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,560
takes place.

1646
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,880
Ford's not going to

1647
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,420
sell anything,

1648
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:14,720
right?

1649
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:15,720
So that's what

1650
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,000
business and price

1651
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,760
discovery, you're

1652
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,660
looking for those

1653
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,220
levels, but you

1654
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,120
want those levels

1655
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:22,880
to be fair.

1656
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,740
Now, let's take a

1657
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,720
look at what's going

1658
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,400
on here.

1659
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,560
We saw the price,

1660
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,540
we saw the

1661
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
fairest price to do

1662
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,860
business initially

1663
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,880
migrate a little

1664
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,200
lower.

1665
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,520
Now, when the market

1666
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,860
breaks late in the

1667
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,780
day, the fairest price

1668
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,720
in this example did

1669
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,760
not migrate lower.

1670
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,860
the fairest price

1671
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,040
did not migrate

1672
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,460
lower.

1673
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,020
So you're coming

1674
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,060
down here, and the

1675
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,120
fact that it didn't

1676
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,940
migrate lower is also

1677
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,580
a very valuable piece

1678
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,200
of information.

1679
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,720
We talk about

1680
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,940
situations where

1681
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,340
people get caught

1682
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,840
short in a

1683
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,260
marketplace.

1684
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,800
When the point of

1685
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,140
control doesn't

1686
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,620
migrate lower, but

1687
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,900
price goes lower, and

1688
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,740
it may be because

1689
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,680
there's some rumor,

1690
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,140
somebody said

1691
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,280
something on CNBC,

1692
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and everybody's

1693
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,740
going to sell, or

1694
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,240
it hits some

1695
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,860
technical level that

1696
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:23,980
brings in all kind

1697
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,100
of sellers, and

1698
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,660
you're looking, if

1699
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,340
you're looking just

1700
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,440
at price, and most

1701
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,480
people cannot trade

1702
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,880
successfully because

1703
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,460
they are too trapped

1704
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,200
by price.

1705
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,460
They can't put the

1706
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,540
price in context.

1707
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,000
But you look here,

1708
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,720
in this example, price

1709
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,680
goes lower, it's

1710
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,060
trying to find, it's

1711
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,580
trying to find a

1712
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,460
place for two-sided

1713
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,420
trade to take place.

1714
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,460
It's advertising, it's

1715
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,860
advertising down here

1716
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,120
for buyers, but the

1717
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,080
fairest price to do

1718
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,800
business is up here.

1719
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,500
When this kind of

1720
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,580
situation happens, how

1721
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,900
many people have heard

1722
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,440
the term short in the

1723
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,640
hole?

1724
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,340
When you talk about

1725
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,580
somebody, market people,

1726
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,080
being short in the hole,

1727
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,100
all that means is

1728
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,260
you're being short,

1729
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,400
you're getting short

1730
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,860
at bad prices.

1731
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,600
That's common

1732
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,640
parlance that you hear

1733
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,960
for years around the

1734
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,440
trading community.

1735
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,460
When you get people

1736
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,200
caught short in the

1737
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:18,760
hole, it means they

1738
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,420
got emotionally trapped,

1739
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,960
they got short at

1740
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,240
very bad prices, and

1741
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,260
at that point in time,

1742
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,780
watch out, you have a

1743
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,300
potential disaster on

1744
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:29,660
your hand.

1745
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,980
So this clue up here,

1746
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,600
the point of control is

1747
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,240
not going lower, let's

1748
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,320
take a look at where

1749
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,420
we go next with this.

1750
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,040
And the people that

1751
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,320
know me know that I

1752
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,000
prefer to talk about

1753
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,320
things that have

1754
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,380
actually happened, and

1755
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,420
that I've written about

1756
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,680
or put out notices

1757
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,180
ahead of time, because

1758
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,100
I don't like to ever be

1759
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,120
thought of as cherry

1760
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,100
picking, trying to find

1761
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
examples and make it

1762
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,420
fit.

1763
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,440
In this particular day,

1764
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,500
the point of control,

1765
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,060
this is real,

1766
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,320
you see this going

1767
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,840
down, it's not uncommon

1768
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
to have this line be

1769
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,560
almost a 45 degree line,

1770
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,980
don't make it exact like

1771
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,300
that.

1772
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,300
But in the last four

1773
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,360
periods, price is trading

1774
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,340
lower, but the point of

1775
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,700
control is not migrating

1776
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,160
lower, traders are getting

1777
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,620
short in the hole.

1778
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,740
Look at the point of

1779
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,920
control, the date was

1780
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,260
April 21st, 2010.

1781
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,380
Okay, let's take a look

1782
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,500
what happened.

1783
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,600
This is an email sent at

1784
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,660
251, I advise two hedge

1785
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:37,940
funds.

1786
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,160
I advise three trading

1787
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,340
companies in Chicago and

1788
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,100
two hedge funds.

1789
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,260
this is an email sent, and you

1790
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,260
can see the time and the

1791
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:46,500
day.

1792
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,280
Look at the POC not

1793
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,900
migrating lower, sellers are

1794
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,840
getting caught short in the

1795
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,860
hole, 45 degree line.

1796
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,880
And then I say here, no

1797
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,620
outside event, and we could be

1798
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,740
setting up for a route.

1799
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,280
Meaning no outside event, no

1800
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,700
exogenous event, no unexpected

1801
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,320
announcement.

1802
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,900
Okay, so this is actual, there's

1803
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,860
the date that's going to be

1804
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:08,440
reproduced.

1805
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,260
Let's back up for one second.

1806
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,260
Look at the profile, so you

1807
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,160
see the profile, you see this

1808
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,080
thing setting up.

1809
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,940
Now imagine yourself as a

1810
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,420
trader getting caught here,

1811
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,560
because what is price doing?

1812
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:23,660
Okay, price is just going

1813
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,100
lower and lower and lower.

1814
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,340
A lot of traders, what happens

1815
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,700
to a lot of traders that got on

1816
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,920
short early in the morning, and

1817
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,020
let's say this thing's going

1818
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,860
down, they love it, right?

1819
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
And Keith, what tendency might

1820
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:36,980
you do at this point?

1821
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,980
You start pressing it, right?

1822
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,940
You got, and I know because

1823
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,940
I've seen you trade, you got,

1824
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,760
you start off here, and you're

1825
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,680
pressing it, you're pressing

1826
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,900
it, you're pressing it, and

1827
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,900
it's feeling pretty good, because

1828
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,300
price is going your way.

1829
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,420
You're patting yourself on the

1830
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,420
back, and sometimes not

1831
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,860
recognizing the trap that is

1832
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:54,200
building.

1833
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,420
Okay, there's the caper, there's

1834
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:56,860
the low.

1835
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,960
We make the low, point and

1836
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,380
control didn't go, look what

1837
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,820
happens late in the day.

1838
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,080
We rally all the way back to

1839
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,360
the point of control.

1840
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,580
The value area, again, we

1841
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,320
introduced it briefly earlier.

1842
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,840
It's where approximately 70%

1843
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,940
of the daily trade takes place.

1844
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:17,720
Okay?

1845
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,120
And there's nothing, there's

1846
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,740
nothing magical about it.

1847
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,700
It's just a way to think

1848
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,720
about the market, and to think

1849
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,580
about price versus value.

1850
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,520
One of the things you'll hear

1851
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,640
from us consistently is we trade

1852
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,020
value, not price.

1853
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,600
The day we're seeing follow, it's

1854
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,020
completed, the profile graphic

1855
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,200
reveals the value area.

1856
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,360
This is calculated for you.

1857
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,660
Terry, are you here?

1858
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,780
Terry is back there.

1859
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,840
Terry Liverman owns a company

1860
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,080
called Window Trader.

1861
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,140
We get these, we use Window

1862
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,980
Trader, and it calculates the value

1863
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,480
area for you.

1864
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,660
As you become more efficient, you

1865
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,960
will start to visualize what the

1866
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,320
market profile will look like

1867
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,040
prior to the end of the day.

1868
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,740
Now, when we're talking about

1869
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,480
really becoming a successful

1870
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,240
trader, one of the things we say is

1871
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,960
visualize, don't predict.

1872
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,220
So, for example, you've had just a

1873
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:23,860
little introduction.

1874
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,280
Let's say that we have a market

1875
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,140
that opens, and it's got a pretty

1876
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,620
aggressive buying tail right off the

1877
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,660
opening in the morning, and the

1878
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,320
market starts to auction higher.

1879
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:35,600
Okay?

1880
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:38,540
You start to visualize this is a

1881
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,640
pretty strong day, and you start

1882
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,940
to see that this market's moving

1883
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,300
higher.

1884
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,420
You start to visualize what the

1885
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,580
profile's going to look like.

1886
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,060
Now, you're not at that level yet,

1887
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,680
but this is ultimately where you

1888
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,380
want to get to.

1889
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,400
The faster you can visualize what

1890
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,540
the completed profile is going to

1891
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,320
look like when the day is over,

1892
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:02,520
the better you're going to be able

1893
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,080
to position the trades, the better

1894
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,840
you're going to be able to control

1895
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,580
your risk in this whole situation.

1896
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,300
So, this is the goal.

1897
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,780
This is just kind of a normal

1898
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,280
profile.

1899
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,640
We don't get many of these.

1900
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,480
We don't get many of these, but

1901
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,460
we're just using it to keep bringing

1902
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:19,400
the idea back.

1903
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:20,260
Okay.

1904
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,020
Incomplete auctions are revealed

1905
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,540
through the profile shape.

1906
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,040
Here, we have the low made early.

1907
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,460
The D auction opens and begins to

1908
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:37,100
complete, completes the profile.

1909
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,060
Look over here.

1910
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,140
That would be your initial balance

1911
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,700
and just a little more.

1912
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,740
As you get more comfortable with the profile

1913
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,860
and you get more comfortable with the range

1914
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:54,020
of a particular stock or future you're trading,

1915
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,400
all of a sudden, you may look at a very narrow range like this

1916
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,520
and you say, wait a minute, it's highly unlikely

1917
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,920
that the range is going to be that tight

1918
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,580
for the remainder of the day.

1919
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,860
So, if you see this

1920
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,760
and you look at this example,

1921
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,020
you have a buying tail.

1922
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,680
You don't have any completion up here.

1923
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,480
Now, it's not always completed.

1924
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,020
It doesn't always fit perfectly.

1925
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,000
But, when you look at this,

1926
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,640
you see that the buyers were more aggressive

1927
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,580
than were the what?

1928
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,160
Than were the sellers, right?

1929
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:27,800
So, now, you say, wait a minute,

1930
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,300
let's take a look at what's going on here.

1931
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:32,700
Unlikely, we're going to hold that balance.

1932
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,380
So, the first thing you ought to be thinking about

1933
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,460
is opportunity.

1934
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,940
You ought to be thinking about, wait a minute,

1935
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,980
is there an opportunity setting up?

1936
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,180
Years ago, when I used to advise

1937
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,380
a lot of the folks on the Board of Trade,

1938
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,660
I used to say, when you saw a quiet market like this,

1939
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,100
here's what the Board of Trade guys used to do.

1940
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:53,440
When you had a quiet market like this in the first period,

1941
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,300
they'd go out and have coffee, right?

1942
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,760
They'd go out and have coffee.

1943
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,820
There's nothing going on.

1944
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,940
Same thing happens to me.

1945
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,900
I'm in front of the machine, nothing going on.

1946
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,700
I go down and make some cereal or something.

1947
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,440
No, no.

1948
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,120
When you've got this,

1949
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,700
my statement ought to be, guys,

1950
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,320
do not go out for coffee.

1951
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,980
The hair on the back of your neck

1952
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,980
ought to be standing straight up.

1953
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,940
Because there ought to be

1954
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,100
a significant opportunity

1955
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,960
beginning to develop here.

1956
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:23,420
It's unlikely you're going to hold that range for the day.

1957
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,700
So, we have a buying tail on the bottom.

1958
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,960
We don't have anything earlier.

1959
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,200
Earlier, one of the slides you saw,

1960
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,440
when you don't have a selling tail,

1961
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,380
you have an auction that's not completed.

1962
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,940
Not as simple as that.

1963
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,160
But then, now you look and you say,

1964
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,120
wait a minute, what happens?

1965
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,540
We introduced our term earlier called range extension.

1966
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,340
Now, what happens?

1967
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,380
The market's creeping up in here.

1968
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,020
You had some evidence of buying early,

1969
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,000
not completed.

1970
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,660
All of a sudden, in the D period,

1971
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,920
the market comes to life.

1972
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,540
We come out of this narrow range.

1973
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,140
We come out of this narrow range,

1974
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,760
and as we would say,

1975
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,060
the market goes bit.

1976
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:01,980
All of a sudden,

1977
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,000
the market has come in.

1978
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,160
The bidders are there.

1979
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,540
Price is going higher.

1980
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,060
And you can see D period,

1981
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,500
E, F, G, H, I.

1982
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,340
Let me introduce this term right here for a second.

1983
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,360
We have a term that we call one time framing.

1984
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,520
One time framing is nothing more

1985
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,020
than when one period,

1986
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,180
and let's say it's one time framing up,

1987
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,800
one period does not take out the low of the prior period,

1988
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,360
does either stay within the range

1989
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,440
or take out the high.

1990
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,040
So, in the market,

1991
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,320
the auction starts here,

1992
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,340
pretty aggressive.

1993
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,180
And remember,

1994
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,700
I can split these profiles out at any point.

1995
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,680
You've seen completed profiles,

1996
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,340
but I also can split them out.

1997
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,100
So, when something changes here,

1998
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:48,760
it gets aggressive.

1999
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,060
There we go.

2000
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:50,760
The D period.

2001
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,460
Did E period take out the low of D period?

2002
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:54,660
No.

2003
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,920
Did F period take out the low of E period?

2004
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,500
No.

2005
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,960
Did G period take out the low of F period?

2006
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,500
Did H?

2007
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,060
No.

2008
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:02,940
I?

2009
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:03,500
No.

2010
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,400
Okay?

2011
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,520
And J did not.

2012
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,020
You came up in balance in J.

2013
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:07,660
So,

2014
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,260
for 30,

2015
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,580
60,

2016
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:11,580
90,

2017
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:12,800
120,

2018
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,780
150,

2019
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,520
you can go on up,

2020
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,080
that once the market got started here,

2021
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,580
the market one time framed up

2022
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:20,440
for

2023
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,200
all the way through the J period

2024
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,520
and close to the end of the day.

2025
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,220
I was shocked

2026
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,560
as this has always been

2027
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,980
a very natural thing to me.

2028
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:31,840
I was shocked

2029
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,680
the first time

2030
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,060
I had a room

2031
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,360
of probably 50 to 60

2032
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,460
professional traders

2033
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,980
and I asked the question

2034
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,640
how many people

2035
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,360
understand what one time framing is

2036
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,320
and I got one response.

2037
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,900
I was shocked

2038
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,360
because it is just

2039
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,600
such a helpful thing

2040
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,000
to know

2041
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,020
what is going on

2042
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,100
because

2043
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,380
what happens

2044
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,900
if you understand this,

2045
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,500
you don't fade

2046
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,100
and fade

2047
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,180
means going against the market.

2048
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:00,460
So,

2049
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,880
in this direction,

2050
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:02,640
the market,

2051
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,840
the auction is going which way?

2052
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,840
The going is higher,

2053
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:06,100
right?

2054
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,700
The biggest single mistake

2055
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,280
that traders make

2056
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,440
is fading a trend day

2057
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,660
or fading a market

2058
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,040
that's one time framing

2059
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,020
higher or lower.

2060
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,560
Now,

2061
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,040
if you fall into the trap

2062
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,720
because it was quiet

2063
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,560
to begin with,

2064
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:22,820
right?

2065
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,580
You fall into the trap,

2066
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,900
the market's going higher

2067
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:26,400
and you think,

2068
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:26,880
oh boy,

2069
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:27,780
you know,

2070
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,100
if I could have sold this thing

2071
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,520
at 10 this morning,

2072
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,080
I didn't.

2073
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:31,780
But boy,

2074
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,380
at 18,

2075
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,660
it looks like a real sell

2076
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:34,320
here at 18.

2077
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:35,660
Intuitively,

2078
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:36,060
you just say,

2079
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:36,400
oh boy,

2080
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,880
I got to sell it here.

2081
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,380
We're programmed to think

2082
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,140
that that's less risk

2083
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,100
and it actually,

2084
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,440
if it's one time framing up,

2085
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,180
you're taking

2086
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,400
a tremendous amount of risk.

2087
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,300
Intuitively,

2088
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:46,960
you don't think that.

2089
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,320
You think,

2090
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:47,480
well,

2091
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,260
I've got less risk

2092
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:48,860
selling something

2093
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,960
at 8 than I do at 6.

2094
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,520
Not necessarily true

2095
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,560
if the market's

2096
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,540
one time framing up.

2097
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,620
When you see

2098
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,720
something like this,

2099
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,860
one of the things

2100
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:58,640
you're trying to learn

2101
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,780
to do is just

2102
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,320
go with it.

2103
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,540
We make more errors

2104
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,260
by outthinking ourselves,

2105
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,900
by fighting against

2106
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,820
what the market's

2107
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,740
actually doing.

2108
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,460
And it doesn't make any,

2109
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,220
we've got a room

2110
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,620
of people here today

2111
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,700
that run from

2112
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,000
extremely experienced

2113
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,040
to very inexperienced.

2114
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,000
But I will promise you,

2115
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:20,680
because I know

2116
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,220
an awful lot

2117
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:21,940
of very experienced

2118
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:22,260
traders,

2119
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,340
we make the same mistake.

2120
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,700
We get it in our head

2121
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,300
that something's

2122
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,020
not worth something

2123
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,480
and we sit down there

2124
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,300
and we do something

2125
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:29,820
like this,

2126
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,000
the day is over

2127
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,700
and we look at

2128
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,120
why we weren't successful

2129
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,560
and we say,

2130
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,160
how in the world

2131
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,620
could I have done that?

2132
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,940
Because we got

2133
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:38,940
something else

2134
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,920
in our mind,

2135
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,720
we weren't objectively

2136
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,840
looking at the market

2137
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,040
generated information.

2138
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,820
do not short a market

2139
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,560
that's one time

2140
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,180
framing up.

2141
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,360
Anyhow,

2142
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:49,980
we get off in tangents

2143
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:50,760
but that's alright.

2144
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:51,940
We started,

2145
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,160
we take the completed day,

2146
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,180
we started down here,

2147
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,200
we had a buying tail,

2148
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,920
we had an uncompleted profile,

2149
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,020
a very narrow base,

2150
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,040
they came into the market

2151
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,140
and all of a sudden

2152
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,420
the auction started

2153
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:03,960
to go higher.

2154
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,680
Now there's a lot

2155
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,560
more information

2156
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,420
in here,

2157
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,100
a lot more information.

2158
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,920
but I just want you

2159
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,780
to kind of get

2160
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,920
a feel

2161
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,960
of what's going on

2162
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,460
and introducing

2163
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,700
the phrase

2164
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,620
of one time frame.

2165
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,000
Let's kind of continue

2166
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,140
on with our example.

2167
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:22,420
Again,

2168
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,780
you've heard this before,

2169
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,020
in the old days

2170
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,100
when,

2171
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,820
I used to have

2172
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,280
a discount futures firm,

2173
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,720
JF Dalton Associates,

2174
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,080
and in those days

2175
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,980
there's most

2176
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,220
of the early business

2177
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:38,940
and there were

2178
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,120
a lot of floor traders

2179
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:40,680
on the market.

2180
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,500
The really good

2181
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,360
floor traders

2182
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,080
developed a skill

2183
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:45,900
and that skill

2184
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,000
was listening

2185
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,980
to the market.

2186
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,100
Okay,

2187
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,400
if you went up

2188
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,800
to yesterday's high,

2189
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,140
you went up

2190
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,220
to yesterday's high

2191
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,340
and we all know

2192
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:56,980
that floor traders

2193
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,820
might play games,

2194
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,780
what are you going to have

2195
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,860
at yesterday's high?

2196
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,280
You're going to have stops.

2197
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:04,320
Okay,

2198
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,880
a great game

2199
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,160
for the floor trader

2200
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,120
at that point in time

2201
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,580
was to bid the market up

2202
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,220
to get the stops.

2203
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,760
Once you get the stops,

2204
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,040
you force people to buy.

2205
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,160
If you're a floor trader,

2206
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,580
how do you profit

2207
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,440
from hitting the stops

2208
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,720
by selling into it, right?

2209
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,380
You bid it up,

2210
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,580
you force the stops to cover,

2211
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,660
you now sold.

2212
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:28,840
All right?

2213
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,020
Now,

2214
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,040
if that's as simple

2215
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:32,800
as it was,

2216
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,000
what would happen?

2217
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,680
The floor traders

2218
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,780
would bid the market up,

2219
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,500
they would hear

2220
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,760
the level of,

2221
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,020
the orders are coming

2222
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:40,600
into the pit

2223
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,260
or what we call

2224
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,200
the outside flow of orders

2225
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:43,920
or the lack

2226
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,180
of outside flow of orders.

2227
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,740
So the market comes in,

2228
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,400
you take out

2229
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,280
yesterday's high,

2230
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:49,800
this, I said,

2231
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,460
means buy

2232
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,360
on the floor.

2233
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,160
So you go up,

2234
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:52,900
you take out

2235
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,980
yesterday's high,

2236
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:54,760
you hit the stops

2237
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,100
and all of a sudden

2238
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,520
it gets deathly quiet.

2239
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,620
It gets deathly quiet,

2240
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,680
what does that tell you?

2241
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,460
There is no more

2242
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,880
flow of orders

2243
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:04,520
from the outside.

2244
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,420
So the good floor trader

2245
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,840
intuitively went from

2246
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,560
buy,

2247
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:09,920
hands out,

2248
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,620
means sell.

2249
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,360
He heard the market,

2250
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,680
he heard there was

2251
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,460
no outside flow of orders.

2252
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,160
Okay?

2253
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,520
Gave him a tremendous advantage.

2254
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,720
Now,

2255
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:20,780
you take out

2256
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,540
yesterday's high

2257
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,420
and the level of volume

2258
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,780
increases tremendously.

2259
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:25,600
So,

2260
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,820
higher prices

2261
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:27,960
instead of cutting off

2262
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:28,460
activity,

2263
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:29,940
the level goes up,

2264
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:30,980
the bids are coming in,

2265
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,920
so that's bringing in

2266
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,420
more orders.

2267
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,840
It gets very noisy,

2268
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:36,720
keeps bidding,

2269
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,020
but they heard

2270
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:38,800
that go on.

2271
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:39,740
Okay?

2272
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:40,560
Now,

2273
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,020
the floor,

2274
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,420
so much of the business

2275
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,160
on the floors

2276
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,020
has gone away.

2277
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,060
That advantage

2278
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,020
to the floor trader

2279
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:48,980
is gone.

2280
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,540
My single biggest

2281
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,560
client base

2282
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,120
has been

2283
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,840
among floor traders

2284
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,240
that were transitioning

2285
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,700
from the floor

2286
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,460
to learning to trade

2287
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,280
upstairs

2288
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,040
off of electronic screens.

2289
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,060
It's a totally

2290
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,040
new business tool.

2291
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,600
They lost the ability

2292
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,940
to hear

2293
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,700
what was going on

2294
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:12,820
on the floor of the market.

2295
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,960
When that happens

2296
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,160
and when you're learning

2297
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:16,700
to trade

2298
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,000
from an electronic screen

2299
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,660
upstairs,

2300
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,840
what you start to do

2301
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,020
is you start to

2302
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,020
replace hearing

2303
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,920
with understanding

2304
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,780
structure

2305
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,640
and how structure

2306
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,140
builds

2307
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,860
in there.

2308
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,100
The structure,

2309
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,260
the structure

2310
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,020
is your weight.

2311
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,620
In other words,

2312
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:35,220
you,

2313
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,000
what you used to hear,

2314
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,600
you now develop

2315
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,300
an ability

2316
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,380
to see.

2317
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:41,740
Some of the

2318
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,740
more experienced

2319
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:43,360
foreign traders,

2320
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,580
they could tell you,

2321
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,300
for example,

2322
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,740
right down here

2323
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:47,260
in the low,

2324
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,540
if this is the opening price,

2325
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,760
they could tell you

2326
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,580
if this was the low,

2327
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:51,420
they could look at it,

2328
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,520
they can't hear it anymore,

2329
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,720
but they can still hear it

2330
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,280
in their mind.

2331
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,420
The bids were pretty aggressive.

2332
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,240
So,

2333
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,080
now,

2334
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,320
I just want to look

2335
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,480
at some ideas

2336
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:02,140
of structure.

2337
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,420
We're not going to cover

2338
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,340
this in any detail

2339
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:04,960
just yet,

2340
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,440
but when I see

2341
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,220
a structure

2342
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,460
that goes

2343
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,760
thin on the bottom

2344
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,620
and it starts

2345
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,360
to look like

2346
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,200
the letter P

2347
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,140
on top,

2348
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,520
if you have

2349
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:17,900
don't know

2350
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,700
anything about

2351
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,060
what we're talking about

2352
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,480
doesn't mean

2353
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,140
anything to you,

2354
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:21,460
but

2355
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,240
from experience,

2356
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,160
I know

2357
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,480
that when I have

2358
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,220
a P shape

2359
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:26,900
in the structure,

2360
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,540
that is an indication

2361
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,560
that I have

2362
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,760
short covering.

2363
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:31,560
Okay?

2364
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:32,960
Another way

2365
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,000
we refer to

2366
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,680
short covering

2367
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,280
is old business.

2368
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,020
In other words,

2369
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:38,760
the people

2370
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,720
that have already

2371
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,360
been short,

2372
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,420
how do you

2373
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,720
cover a short?

2374
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,920
If you've been short,

2375
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,280
you have to buy

2376
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,000
in order to

2377
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,680
cover that short.

2378
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,740
That is old business.

2379
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,900
You're closing out

2380
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,140
something you already had

2381
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,760
versus new business.

2382
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,840
If you came in

2383
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,640
to buy something

2384
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,860
for the first time,

2385
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,040
that would be

2386
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:58,980
new business.

2387
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,680
The visualized structure,

2388
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,020
if you had

2389
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:03,860
a market

2390
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:04,780
started out

2391
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,340
like this

2392
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,040
at the bottom

2393
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,100
with a relatively

2394
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,240
thin structure

2395
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,540
and you had

2396
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,320
a combination

2397
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,720
of short covering

2398
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,840
and almost all

2399
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,660
rallies begin

2400
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,400
with short covering

2401
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,540
and they had

2402
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,400
that short covering

2403
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,260
joined by

2404
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,340
new buying

2405
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,540
so you had

2406
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,260
old business

2407
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,120
combined with

2408
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:22,840
new business,

2409
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,340
then more than likely

2410
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:25,760
what's going to

2411
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,540
happen to your structure,

2412
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,660
it's going to

2413
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,000
elongate out

2414
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,820
because you've got

2415
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:32,360
two different kinds

2416
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:32,860
of business

2417
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:33,340
coming in.

2418
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,760
When your structure

2419
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,920
doesn't elongate

2420
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,640
and you start

2421
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,080
to get the formation

2422
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:39,820
that looks like

2423
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,560
the letter P,

2424
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,680
you had

2425
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,800
old business,

2426
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:43,900
the old business

2427
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:44,780
was coming in,

2428
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:45,900
people were covering

2429
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:46,440
shorts,

2430
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,800
but it wasn't

2431
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,660
joined by

2432
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:49,340
new business.

2433
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,500
When you look

2434
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,820
over on the

2435
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,400
right side,

2436
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,060
let's go all the way

2437
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:56,580
from the left

2438
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,220
to the right,

2439
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:58,540
let's take the

2440
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,220
mirror image

2441
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,300
of short covering

2442
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,620
would be

2443
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,020
long liquidation.

2444
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:04,600
So let's say

2445
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,460
you have traders

2446
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,060
that have gotten

2447
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:06,740
too long,

2448
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:07,480
for example,

2449
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,380
momentum traders

2450
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,120
that have gotten

2451
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:09,720
too long

2452
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,240
and all of a sudden

2453
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,760
the liquidation

2454
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,500
starts,

2455
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,120
but it's liquidation

2456
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,240
not joined by

2457
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,380
new fresh shorts

2458
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:17,820
in the market,

2459
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,740
it's just liquidating

2460
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,840
a long position,

2461
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,200
you tend to get

2462
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,000
the mirror image

2463
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,860
of the P formation

2464
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,140
which is the letter B.

2465
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,260
Okay?

2466
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:27,180
Now,

2467
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,580
again,

2468
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,500
there's not enough

2469
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,480
information for you

2470
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,980
to take and use

2471
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,100
yet with that

2472
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,120
other than to have

2473
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,280
increase your

2474
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,120
understanding

2475
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,240
of what is going

2476
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,320
on in the

2477
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:40,760
marketplace.

2478
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,480
For example,

2479
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:43,860
here's a tough one

2480
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:44,500
that most people

2481
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,420
have a lot of

2482
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,360
difficulty with.

2483
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:49,340
Does short covering,

2484
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,140
after the short

2485
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,440
covering is completed,

2486
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,820
does it strengthen

2487
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,460
or weaken

2488
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,060
a market?

2489
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,740
How many people

2490
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,620
think it strengthens

2491
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,040
the market?

2492
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:02,700
Okay?

2493
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,360
And how many people

2494
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,260
think it weakens

2495
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:04,680
the market?

2496
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,380
And how many people

2497
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,040
don't know?

2498
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:07,920
Okay?

2499
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,520
Short covering,

2500
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,640
when the short

2501
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,520
covering is over,

2502
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,420
it actually weakens

2503
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,020
the underlying

2504
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:15,140
structure of the market.

2505
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,280
Because if somebody's

2506
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:16,540
short,

2507
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:17,620
what do they have to do

2508
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,360
to cover their short?

2509
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,440
They have to buy,

2510
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:20,720
right?

2511
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,240
And once you take

2512
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,080
that buy,

2513
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,340
that buy inventory

2514
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,480
out of the market,

2515
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,160
you've actually weakened

2516
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,660
the underlying structure

2517
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,360
of the market.

2518
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,760
It's only one data point.

2519
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,060
But it's something

2520
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,000
to remember.

2521
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,620
When you have

2522
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,020
long liquidation,

2523
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:37,780
okay,

2524
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:38,480
when you get the

2525
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,360
long liquidation,

2526
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:39,880
again,

2527
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,020
it's kind of

2528
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:41,940
the mirror image.

2529
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:42,780
Again,

2530
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,000
we are just touching

2531
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,760
on concepts.

2532
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,360
There's far more

2533
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,160
to it than this.

2534
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,780
I'm just kind of

2535
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,980
walking you along

2536
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,240
to get some idea

2537
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,780
of the importance

2538
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,740
of understanding

2539
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:55,820
the structure

2540
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:56,820
of a market.

2541
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:57,720
And that there is

2542
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,080
structure to a market.

2543
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,480
Just as there's structure,

2544
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,140
if you go to Sotheby's

2545
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,760
for an auction,

2546
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,220
there is structure

2547
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:04,720
to the way

2548
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,660
that auction is handled.

2549
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:06,320
They have rules,

2550
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:07,240
they have regulations,

2551
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,960
they have a procedure

2552
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,420
for that auction.

2553
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,320
Any auction you go to

2554
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,660
will have some kind

2555
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,840
of structure to it.

2556
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:15,720
Now,

2557
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,420
the day in the middle,

2558
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,620
the structure in the middle,

2559
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,160
the two books

2560
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:21,920
you should read,

2561
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,700
I've written two books.

2562
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,340
The first one

2563
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:24,940
was called

2564
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:26,240
Mind Over Markets.

2565
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,580
Mind Over Markets,

2566
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,340
the first book,

2567
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,820
is more linear.

2568
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,260
Traders seem to enjoy

2569
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,560
that market,

2570
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,500
that book more

2571
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,200
because it feels

2572
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:40,900
more linear,

2573
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,280
it feels more understandable,

2574
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,060
the definitions

2575
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,700
aren't as ambiguous

2576
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,220
in it.

2577
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,920
The second book

2578
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,120
is called

2579
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,680
Markets in Profile.

2580
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,680
The best book

2581
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,140
is actually

2582
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,200
Markets in Profile.

2583
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:54,940
It's more ambiguous,

2584
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,980
it's harder to understand,

2585
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,080
but guess what?

2586
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,180
The harder it is

2587
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:00,860
to understand,

2588
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,000
the fewer people

2589
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,280
that are going

2590
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,120
to stick with it,

2591
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,780
the greater the edge

2592
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,500
that you're going

2593
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,640
to get with it.

2594
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,520
You need to read

2595
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,220
both books.

2596
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:10,760
But,

2597
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,200
the first book

2598
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,160
is more mechanical,

2599
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,560
we've changed

2600
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,380
the terms,

2601
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:17,420
when I wrote

2602
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:18,240
the first book,

2603
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,680
Mind Over Markets,

2604
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,020
I basically

2605
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,260
used the terms

2606
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:23,260
that were introduced

2607
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:23,820
to me by

2608
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,760
Pete Stonelmeyer

2609
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,980
who introduced

2610
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,020
this concept

2611
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:27,780
to begin with.

2612
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,160
As I got

2613
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:30,940
more experience,

2614
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,540
I'm not as comfortable

2615
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,820
with the terms,

2616
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,820
so I've renamed

2617
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:36,400
the terms.

2618
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,460
The first term

2619
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,020
to start with

2620
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:38,780
is what I call

2621
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,100
a primary,

2622
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,500
a primary day.

2623
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:42,620
In other words,

2624
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,360
when I call it

2625
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,280
a primary day,

2626
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:45,620
it's a day

2627
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:46,620
that we have

2628
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,080
a tendency

2629
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:47,980
to see

2630
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,120
more often.

2631
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,340
It's a more

2632
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,440
common type

2633
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:51,920
of day.

2634
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,220
In this day,

2635
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,860
you'll see the high

2636
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,100
was made in B period,

2637
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:56,380
you see the point

2638
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:56,820
of control

2639
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:57,320
in the center,

2640
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,180
you see a little bit

2641
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:00,820
of range extension

2642
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,080
to the downside.

2643
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,360
It's kind of the day

2644
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,640
I use to measure

2645
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,900
other days

2646
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:07,940
against now.

2647
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,980
While we're at it,

2648
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:11,820
it's a nuance.

2649
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:12,780
One of the things

2650
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:13,600
that you'll hear

2651
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,260
from us

2652
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,400
multiple times

2653
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,500
is the importance

2654
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,560
of nuances.

2655
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:19,640
Nuances make

2656
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,900
a huge amount

2657
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:21,440
of difference.

2658
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,380
Unsuccessful traders

2659
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,000
have a tendency

2660
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,660
to skip over nuances.

2661
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,520
You ever have somebody

2662
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,160
that's not telling

2663
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:30,840
you the truth?

2664
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:31,880
They tell you

2665
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,560
a story,

2666
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,220
they look in your eyes,

2667
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:36,640
and they just

2668
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,760
intuitively know

2669
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,000
that you didn't

2670
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,380
quite buy their story.

2671
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,800
What do they do next?

2672
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,420
They kind of repeat

2673
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,240
themselves, right?

2674
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,320
They kind of repeat

2675
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:47,700
themselves.

2676
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,300
They kind of tell you

2677
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,440
the story again,

2678
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:52,500
and they put just

2679
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,320
a little bit

2680
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,400
of different twist,

2681
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,700
a little bit different

2682
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,180
twist on it.

2683
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,800
And there's information,

2684
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,140
there's information

2685
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:01,820
in that.

2686
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,560
And you start to read

2687
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,640
that kind of information.

2688
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,580
Is it real?

2689
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,400
Are they telling me

2690
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:07,800
the truth?

2691
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,700
Aren't they telling me

2692
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,020
the truth?

2693
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:10,840
You need,

2694
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:11,580
when you look

2695
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,200
at the market,

2696
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,020
you need some way

2697
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:14,680
to judge,

2698
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,580
is what you're seeing

2699
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,480
in price

2700
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,360
the real truth

2701
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,020
behind what is going

2702
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:21,940
on in the market?

2703
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,820
So many times,

2704
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:24,960
the information

2705
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,320
is in a nuance.

2706
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:28,680
Just as the person

2707
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,480
that didn't tell you

2708
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:29,920
the truth

2709
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,200
tends to talk

2710
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,880
a little bit more

2711
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,720
and tends to repeat

2712
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,240
the story,

2713
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,560
the nuance is they're

2714
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,700
probably not telling

2715
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,100
the truth.

2716
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,840
Nuances do matter.

2717
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,080
Nuances separate out

2718
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,960
the winners and the losers.

2719
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,180
I always liked the example.

2720
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,360
I had a very good,

2721
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,360
very good friend

2722
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,380
when I was in the service

2723
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,620
that really desperately

2724
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:51,320
wanted to be

2725
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,680
a professional football player.

2726
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,520
He played for Xavier.

2727
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,060
And he said,

2728
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:55,920
he said,

2729
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:56,240
Jim,

2730
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,000
he said,

2731
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,220
I think what kept me back,

2732
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:58,600
he said,

2733
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,540
I was probably

2734
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,440
just a fraction

2735
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,700
of a second

2736
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,640
too slow

2737
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,400
to get through the hole.

2738
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,900
He was very well built,

2739
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:06,600
very athletic,

2740
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,020
but he said,

2741
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:07,860
just a fraction.

2742
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:08,700
And sometimes,

2743
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,180
it's just a fraction

2744
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,560
that makes the difference

2745
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,720
between winning

2746
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,200
and losing.

2747
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,080
So nuances are important.

2748
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,520
Being able to look

2749
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,660
at a particular day

2750
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,200
like this

2751
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,480
and have some base

2752
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,800
against which to judge

2753
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,260
other nuances

2754
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,680
is very important.

2755
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,340
Side while we're on here,

2756
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,280
very minor,

2757
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,640
but if you go back,

2758
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,080
and I don't ask

2759
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,080
anybody here

2760
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,980
to take

2761
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,400
what I say

2762
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,240
for granted.

2763
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,200
I want you

2764
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,980
to take

2765
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,580
and go take it back,

2766
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,640
study it,

2767
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,980
and make the evaluation

2768
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,860
on your own.

2769
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,140
I'm going to guess,

2770
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,580
and I've not done this

2771
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,900
mathematically

2772
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,060
and systematically,

2773
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,460
I'm going to guess

2774
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,100
that probably

2775
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,560
about someplace

2776
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,460
in the order of

2777
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,060
75 to 80 percent

2778
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:57,800
of the time,

2779
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,620
the high or low

2780
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,380
of a day

2781
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,680
is made

2782
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,920
within the first

2783
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:03,900
hour or so.

2784
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,220
In this particular day,

2785
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,300
we have A period,

2786
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:08,960
B period,

2787
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:10,560
the high was made,

2788
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,040
the high was made

2789
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,220
early in the morning.

2790
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,240
We didn't set this up,

2791
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,060
I just looked at it

2792
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:16,600
right here.

2793
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,240
The low was made

2794
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,420
early in the morning.

2795
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,540
Up there,

2796
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,420
the high was made,

2797
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:23,900
not a completed high,

2798
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:24,340
but it's made

2799
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:24,880
early in the morning.

2800
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,040
But it's just something,

2801
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:26,880
it's a nuance

2802
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,680
to go back,

2803
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:28,920
look at,

2804
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:29,900
and think about.

2805
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,220
There's very valuable

2806
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,240
information in some of that.

2807
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,540
Now, price will mess you

2808
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:35,320
up throughout the day,

2809
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,620
you'll forget about that.

2810
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,540
But if you keep that in mind,

2811
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,460
it can be very helpful.

2812
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,120
Okay?

2813
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,660
Just an idea

2814
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,860
of some of the structure.

2815
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,400
We look here,

2816
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,220
one of the things

2817
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,000
that we talked about earlier,

2818
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,880
here's April 9th,

2819
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,980
we see the market

2820
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,500
break,

2821
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,860
this was a Friday,

2822
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,200
this was a Friday,

2823
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,260
this market

2824
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,240
was absolutely

2825
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,080
dead quiet

2826
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,160
until very late

2827
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:08,740
in the day.

2828
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:09,860
And I hope somebody

2829
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:10,300
will tell me

2830
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:10,840
that's a Friday,

2831
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:11,940
I hope I remember correctly.

2832
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,620
And late in the day,

2833
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:14,900
the market broke

2834
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,780
to the upside.

2835
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,220
The following Monday,

2836
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:23,500
the market remained

2837
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:27,380
within that upper section.

2838
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,280
When markets make

2839
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,480
big price moves

2840
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,140
up or down,

2841
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:32,560
it usually takes

2842
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,060
sometimes the process

2843
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,360
before it reverses itself.

2844
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,120
Here's what's important.

2845
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,000
This structure,

2846
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,340
remember earlier,

2847
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,280
we talked about

2848
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,440
to get away

2849
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,840
and remain away

2850
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,200
from the fairest price

2851
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,980
in which business

2852
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,080
is being conducted.

2853
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,960
Is it more than likely

2854
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,880
going to take volume?

2855
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:53,900
What if it moves away

2856
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,000
from the fairest price

2857
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,860
to conduct business

2858
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,680
but it's not on volume?

2859
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,680
The chances are

2860
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,320
that you're not going

2861
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:01,820
to be able

2862
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:02,580
to hold that.

2863
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,340
It's the same thing.

2864
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:04,760
We're a gentleman

2865
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,360
from Ford.

2866
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,760
Ford raises the price

2867
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,740
of the new Ford Focus.

2868
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,340
They raise it too high.

2869
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,400
Guess what?

2870
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,580
They're not going

2871
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:12,980
to be able

2872
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,040
to hold that level.

2873
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,020
You'll get some

2874
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,860
financing break

2875
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:16,840
or some cash back.

2876
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,140
But sometimes,

2877
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,020
they're not going

2878
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,060
to do it immediately, right?

2879
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,480
If a manufacturer

2880
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,840
raises a price

2881
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:23,660
that's too high,

2882
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:25,620
you know,

2883
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,240
he doesn't get

2884
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,820
the information

2885
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,440
the next day,

2886
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,640
sometimes it may take

2887
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,920
a few days

2888
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,700
or some time

2889
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,720
to sink in.

2890
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,500
The difference is

2891
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,420
everything happens

2892
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,960
exactly the same way.

2893
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,740
In the markets,

2894
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:39,680
it seems to happen

2895
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,020
far quicker sometimes

2896
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:41,980
than it does

2897
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,480
in a manufacturing organization.

2898
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:44,980
But this day,

2899
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:45,580
the market

2900
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:48,340
was not elongating out.

2901
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,200
It probably caught

2902
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:49,620
some short,

2903
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,280
some game playing

2904
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:50,980
late in the day.

2905
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,620
The market went up

2906
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,620
on low volume.

2907
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,960
We held that volume

2908
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,680
on Monday

2909
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,540
and take a look

2910
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:00,760
what happened

2911
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,760
on Tuesday.

2912
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,940
So we came back down

2913
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:05,880
and listen,

2914
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,660
remember the early slide

2915
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:08,640
I was showing you,

2916
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,420
I used a term

2917
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,440
called repair.

2918
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:11,760
Early on,

2919
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,060
I was saying,

2920
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,960
here's one of the things

2921
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:14,980
we're going to get to

2922
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:15,980
by the time

2923
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:16,800
we get through

2924
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,620
the seminar.

2925
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,660
When you have

2926
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,840
poor structure,

2927
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,960
and this is poor structure,

2928
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,460
there's no elongation,

2929
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,200
that didn't go up

2930
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,060
on good volume,

2931
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,420
you balanced

2932
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:27,620
on the following day

2933
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,020
and you came back down

2934
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,860
and you repaired

2935
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,060
this structure.

2936
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:33,980
So this whole thing

2937
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:34,600
was corrected

2938
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,680
a couple of days later.

2939
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:36,440
Now,

2940
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,820
here's what happens

2941
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:38,440
to traders

2942
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,040
very often.

2943
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,300
they don't have

2944
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,220
the patience

2945
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,720
to recognize

2946
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,940
that this

2947
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,160
is an opportunity

2948
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,000
that is setting up.

2949
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,100
But that

2950
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,500
opportunity

2951
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,800
may take

2952
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,440
some time

2953
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:54,980
to develop.

2954
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,900
But let's talk

2955
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:57,600
about odds

2956
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,220
for a second.

2957
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,160
If this,

2958
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,220
if you're lucky,

2959
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,080
let's say you're lucky

2960
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,760
and you caught

2961
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:03,360
this spike

2962
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,200
late in the day,

2963
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,580
you got the spike

2964
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,300
to the upside

2965
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,220
and you caught it

2966
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,720
and when you go home

2967
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,280
on Friday

2968
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,280
and you're long

2969
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:11,800
and you're profit,

2970
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,520
how do you feel?

2971
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,700
You feel pretty good.

2972
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:15,580
You know,

2973
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,000
you're walking around,

2974
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:17,480
you're kind of

2975
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,120
bouncing around

2976
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,040
at the top of the world.

2977
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:19,840
This is pretty neat.

2978
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:20,800
I'm a pretty good trader.

2979
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:21,700
You kind of pat yourself

2980
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:22,340
on the back.

2981
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,120
Oblivious

2982
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,840
to how much risk

2983
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,340
that you really have.

2984
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,160
One of the things

2985
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,120
that we talk about

2986
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,340
with traders

2987
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,660
and

2988
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,080
when I first

2989
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,060
say this statement,

2990
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:38,760
I can look

2991
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,360
in the eyes

2992
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:39,860
of the people

2993
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:40,740
I'm talking to

2994
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:41,540
and I can tell

2995
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:42,580
if they have any idea

2996
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,540
what I'm saying

2997
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,080
or not.

2998
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,080
I can also have

2999
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:45,980
a pretty good idea

3000
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,440
their chances

3001
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,480
of success

3002
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,220
down the road.

3003
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:51,900
Most people

3004
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:52,740
are trading

3005
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,340
and their objective

3006
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:55,220
is just to make money.

3007
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,720
Can you manage return?

3008
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:00,940
You can't manage return.

3009
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,560
The markets,

3010
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,600
whatever the market does,

3011
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,000
you can't affect that.

3012
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:05,600
It's going to do

3013
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,320
what it's going to do.

3014
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,640
You cannot manage return.

3015
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,500
However,

3016
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,080
you can manage your risk.

3017
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:12,300
You can manage

3018
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,100
the risk you take.

3019
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,980
If you learn

3020
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,080
to manage your risk,

3021
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,480
which you can manage,

3022
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,620
but you cannot manage

3023
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:20,180
your return,

3024
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,760
all of a sudden

3025
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,900
you have made

3026
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,400
a huge breakthrough.

3027
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,020
I said earlier

3028
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,280
I advise

3029
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,120
two hedge funds.

3030
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,900
One hedge fund

3031
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,420
has been profitable

3032
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,180
for ten years.

3033
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:33,940
they got hurt

3034
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:34,440
in the break

3035
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,280
a few years ago.

3036
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,900
First time we had lunch

3037
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:38,700
they wanted to talk

3038
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,340
about, you know,

3039
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:40,120
kind of getting

3040
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,040
the business rebuilt.

3041
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,460
We talked about it

3042
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:43,640
and I made this same thing

3043
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,020
about you can manage,

3044
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,280
you can manage risk,

3045
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,180
but you can't manage return.

3046
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,780
I could just see

3047
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,520
kind of the blank

3048
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,060
look at the lunch,

3049
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:54,900
what was going on.

3050
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,780
One of the principles

3051
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,940
of this firm

3052
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,740
was a basketball player

3053
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:03,180
for Utah.

3054
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,920
Very knowledgeable,

3055
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,700
very intelligent trader.

3056
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,900
But it really didn't

3057
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:09,940
sink in at first.

3058
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,440
We talked about this

3059
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,920
about a year later.

3060
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,020
I get a copy,

3061
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,100
I get a copy

3062
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:17,700
of a letter

3063
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,220
that he sent

3064
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:19,940
to his partner.

3065
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,060
His partner identified

3066
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:21,900
me and brought me in.

3067
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:22,220
He said,

3068
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,180
the best thing

3069
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:24,200
you ever did to us

3070
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,360
was introducing

3071
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,000
Jim into the equation.

3072
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,040
He said,

3073
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,320
because it didn't

3074
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,120
make a lot of sense

3075
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:30,900
to me at lunch

3076
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,760
when he first said it,

3077
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,460
but it's made

3078
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,360
all the difference

3079
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,080
to how we manage

3080
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:35,480
the money

3081
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,800
and to our return.

3082
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,440
It finally got,

3083
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,220
what he was saying,

3084
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,120
is we can't manage risk.

3085
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,680
And where we got hurt

3086
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,260
the first time,

3087
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,320
we weren't managing risk.

3088
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,480
We were after return.

3089
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:46,560
He said,

3090
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:47,160
now we know

3091
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,180
how to manage risk.

3092
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,780
And he said,

3093
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,480
the return

3094
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,940
is falling into,

3095
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,420
is falling into place.

3096
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,880
It took a while

3097
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:56,980
for that to sink in.

3098
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,840
It was a very sincere compliment.

3099
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,880
This guy does not

3100
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,220
pass out compliments

3101
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:01,720
for anything.

3102
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,400
It took a period of time

3103
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,320
for it to sink in.

3104
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,680
It took a period of time

3105
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,800
to restructure

3106
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,560
how the entire fund

3107
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,340
was managed.

3108
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,080
But it all came

3109
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,220
down to managing risk.

3110
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:12,560
Now,

3111
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,360
I got another notice

3112
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,340
from him the other day,

3113
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:16,720
and I may have the numbers

3114
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,980
somewhat wrong,

3115
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:18,960
but when the market

3116
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,860
was down big,

3117
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:21,240
over 1,000 point

3118
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,380
and ended up down,

3119
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:23,560
what, about 300, 400?

3120
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,480
The market, I think,

3121
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,420
was off someplace

3122
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,720
in the 3% area.

3123
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:29,460
And if I remember right,

3124
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,780
their fund was off 0.4%.

3125
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,780
That's a big,

3126
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,220
that's a big change.

3127
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,360
We talk about managing risk.

3128
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,460
And that came about

3129
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:41,300
because when this exogenous

3130
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:42,640
event took place,

3131
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,180
exogenous just means

3132
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,360
something that's outside

3133
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,780
of anybody's model

3134
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,900
for running their portfolio

3135
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,000
or running their account.

3136
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,560
When this exogenous event

3137
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,560
took place the other day,

3138
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:54,160
because they had managed risk,

3139
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,940
their loss was minimal.

3140
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:57,560
You talk,

3141
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,100
if you're running

3142
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,060
an awful lot of money

3143
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,460
and you start to get,

3144
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:01,180
you know,

3145
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:02,480
a couple percent difference

3146
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,100
in, that's big money.

3147
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,180
Thank you.

3148
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:05,400
Thank you.

3149
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,160
Thank you.

3150
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:23,140
Thank you.
