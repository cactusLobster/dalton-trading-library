1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Music

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We talk about managing risk and that came about because on when this exogenous event took place

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Exogenous just means something that's outside of anybody's model for, you know, running their portfolio or running their account.

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When this exogenous event took place in, because they had managed risk, their loss was minimal.

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You talk, if you're running them off a lot of money and you start to get, you know, a couple percent difference in, that's big money.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And it has a lot to do with your longer term performance.

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, let's complicate this, right?

8
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If I take this example right here and I say the structure wasn't elongated.

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I got a pop late on Friday afternoon.

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't think it's sustainable.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I look, I get a balancing day on Monday, which is very common after you get a big movement like this.

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
People don't know and they just kind of hold that level.

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And then it comes back and I say, okay, we took all that back on Tuesday.

14
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So far, not terribly difficult to comprehend.

15
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Maybe a little more difficult if you actually had trades on and you're watching this trade to do.

16
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But, you know, when you're not emotionally involved in it, it's not that, it's not quite that difficult.

17
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But, let's complicate it.

18
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000
On the day that the market corrected, we opened, we opened up in here, we came down here, we corrected this.

19
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But then we go back up and we don't leave a good high.

20
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In other words, what is a good high or a secure high would be a high that had a what?

21
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
A selling tail on it.

22
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
A selling tail, when I don't have a selling tail, it's an indication when I got at the highest prices of the day,

23
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
did I have anybody saying, wow, what an opportunity, you bought some.

24
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Okay?

25
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Is that a piece of information?

26
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We organize under the market profile.

27
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We look at the auction process and in the two-way auction process, there's continual information.

28
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Part of the information, we corrected this, there was aggressive buying down here.

29
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And notice, notice how close we came down to this low down here.

30
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Markets are another thing you'll hear very often.

31
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Markets are very, those that have been around a long time, what's the word?

32
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Markets are very what?

33
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Visual.

34
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
They're very visual.

35
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They're not mathematical.

36
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They go to levels that you can see pretty easily.

37
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, if you learn to do your homework ahead of time, you know where those visual references are,

38
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
it will give you a tremendous edge.

39
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Julia used the term early on, we're after an edge.

40
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Whether it's edge in how we look at the market, whether it's an edge of doing our homework, knowing where those visual references are.

41
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So now, the market auctioned lower and corrected this, and it found down here, it found what?

42
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It found buyer, which is the same, basically the same low we had there.

43
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So it came down there, then the market started doing what?

44
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
One time framing up.

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
One time framing up.

46
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There's your buying tail, one time frame, one time frame, one time frame, one time frame.

47
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This does not stop the one time framing, okay?

48
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Just because they match, it takes two ticks to stop one time framing.

49
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So we go all the way up, and I think that's one tick.

50
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So I think this market, until the very last period, basically one time framed up from the bottom.

51
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now, right here, you saw this once below, once before.

52
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You see what is called the afternoon pullback low.

53
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This turned into a trend day.

54
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It started down, it turned into a trend day, which means the trend just went one way from that point on.

55
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Very often, late in a trend day, you will get a period where the market settles down,

56
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and it's doing nothing but adjusting inventory that got a little bit too long.

57
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So you see the market go up.

58
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Late in the day, you'll see some settling.

59
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You may see a little pullback.

60
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The market settles, and then it takes off and runs again.

61
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
A lot of people, first of all, a lot of people get caught.

62
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
As soon as the market starts to settle, they sell into it and not realizing it's just an inventory correction.

63
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Then it turns around and goes back up.

64
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But the point I want to make right here is the afternoon pullback low.

65
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
If the market trends up from the C period, goes on up, we balance late in the day.

66
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
There's the balance.

67
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
K period, H-I-J-K-L-M-N, goes higher.

68
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.000
That K period, that pullback low, is a significant short-term reference point for short-term traders.

69
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Again, I asked this question the first time I had a room full of traders.

70
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I asked how many people know or understand what I mean when I'm talking about the pullback low.

71
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The show of hands was zero.

72
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And I was surprised.

73
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But when it pulls, all that is is an inventory adjustment when it comes back in the afternoon.

74
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Okay?

75
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now, if on that becomes a reference.

76
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000
If on the following day, we don't trade back down below the late afternoon pullback low of a big trend day,

77
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
has anything changed in the market?

78
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
No!

79
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
There's been no change in the marketplace.

80
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Now, if in fact, you don't understand that, you don't understand structure, you don't understand how to look at a market,

81
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you may see price going down towards that level.

82
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And if you're just trading price, oh my golly, you want to get short.

83
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
You want to get short this market.

84
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You can't wait to get short.

85
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And all of a sudden, the market turns around and it reps back up to the upside.

86
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And you don't understand what happened.

87
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
That pullback low, all it was was an inventory adjustment.

88
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And if it doesn't get down below there the next day, all it's telling you is, guess what folks?

89
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Nothing's changed from the late rally and inventory adjustment we had the previous day.

90
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Now, at this point, you're probably starting to see how complex a lot of this information can get.

91
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
You're starting to see nuances, right?

92
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Pullback low.

93
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Pullback low.

94
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
People, how many people before you heard it from me, have ever heard the term pullback low?

95
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
No hands?

96
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
No hands showing and there's a lot of experience in this group.

97
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Okay?

98
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It's a nuance, right?

99
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Do nuances make a difference?

100
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Nuances make a big difference.

101
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Talked about my friend, maybe just a fraction of a step slow getting through the hole like Xavier.

102
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
If you can't get through the hole as a running back, you get tackled, right?

103
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It doesn't take much to make the difference between being successful and unsuccessful.

104
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
There are not many successful traders.

105
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I mean, when you look at, I don't have the actual numbers, I'm not sure anybody does, but all the anecdotal evidence you look at over the years, say that it's a pretty small universe.

106
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But guess what?

107
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It's a very small universe for surgeons that you want to do heart surgery on you too, right?

108
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
There's as much money in this as there is in heart surgery.

109
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So guess what?

110
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's going to be, it's going to be competitive and there's not going to be a lot of people that make it and can do that competition.

111
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Nuances matter.

112
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
If you're having heart surgery, do nuances matter?

113
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
You better believe they do, right?

114
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And you think about the ability to trade successfully and adapt.

115
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You know, a heart surgeon can look at all the x-rays in the world, but once the incision is made, if it's not exactly according, it's not exactly according to the x-ray,

116
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
kind of uncomforting, he goes open and opens the book, right? Or calls his buddy.

117
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
He needs to be able to make that adjustment.

118
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And sometimes it's just a little nuance, but that's really a lot of what separates us.

119
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Okay, let's continue on.

120
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We talked earlier about a primary day.

121
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
A primary day is kind of a standard day, a day that happens more often than not.

122
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:10.000
A variation of a primary day is nothing more than a day that shows a little more aggressiveness.

123
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
A little more aggressiveness and it will generally be a little more directional aggressiveness.

124
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Again, all I'm trying to do is just kind of give you a standard and kind of measure against it.

125
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We started off talking about the bell-shaped curve and we said, but you're not going to see many bell-shaped curves.

126
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
My bell-shaped curve then becomes the primary day.

127
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And if you were looking at data and all of a sudden you saw quite a skew to a bell-shaped curve, you would know something was wrong, right?

128
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I mean, where did you first, where were you first introduced to the bell-shaped curve?

129
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Probably in the grading system when you went to, you know, went to school.

130
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
If you're as old as I am, they did those kind of things.

131
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But, you know, you should have so many people with A's, B's, C's, D's, etc.

132
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.000
All of a sudden, if you have no one with A's and no one with D's, you've got a kind of weird skew to that curve and it starts to tell you something.

133
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And all we've done here is we used the primary day as kind of our bell-shaped curve.

134
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Then we start to look at variations from that to give you an idea of aggressiveness of the auction.

135
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
A variation of a primary day is just a day that's a little more aggressiveness in the marketplace.

136
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Okay, let's take a look at our next day, or our list of days.

137
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So we have the day types.

138
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Primary day, variation of a primary day.

139
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
We have two kinds of trend days.

140
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We have a double distribution trend day and a straight trend day.

141
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
We have a trend day which just goes in one direction all day long.

142
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We have a double distribution trend day which you get one distribution, then that's blown away, and you get a second distribution.

143
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Finally, you have a very balanced type of day.

144
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So again, there's nothing magical about it.

145
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's just a way to be thinking about the market and thinking about the structure.

146
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Primary variation, variation, trend days, two types of trend days, and let's take a look at them.

147
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Okay, here's a trend day that the market basically moves in one direction for most of the day.

148
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Okay?

149
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And those are days, the primary thing a trader, you do not do what to a trend day?

150
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Fade your trade.

151
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You do not fade it.

152
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Ah, let's refate it.

153
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
You're not supposed to fade the trend day.

154
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It is amazing how many traders, when I look over their shoulder, cannot resist, cannot resist fading the trend day.

155
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I know that's happened to somebody in here.

156
00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
How you should be trading on a trend day is you want to get long as early as possible.

157
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
When you've got a trend day, and as soon as you recognize a trend day and the aggressiveness of it, get on the trade.

158
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Get on the trend day.

159
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You then, if you want to do short term trades, you take profits on rallies, buy it back on breaks, versus shorting rallies and covering on the break.

160
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Get the nuance in there.

161
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
You're already long, trend day goes up, take a profit, buy the pullback, take another profit.

162
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
What you don't want to do is watch the trend day go up, attempt to sell it, and buy it back.

163
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You want to trade with the trend day.

164
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You want to trade with the trend day.

165
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Now, some people will be smart, they'll just leave it alone, and stay with it all day.

166
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Most short term traders cannot leave, they can't bring themselves to leave their hands off of it.

167
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And of course, they're always sorry they didn't.

168
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I say a couple, you can always tell me you say a couple smiles, and you know what's going on.

169
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:19.000
If you, in fact, if you, in fact, are going to short a trend day, you have to be right immediately.

170
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
This is the third day I've been in Chicago.

171
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I was here on Monday and Tuesday, this is a Wednesday.

172
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I was here on Monday and Tuesday doing real time trading with three trading groups in Chicago.

173
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Some of you were here for that.

174
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Yesterday morning, I believe it was the crack spread.

175
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The crack spread looked up above a previous day's high, came back in, and we said, okay, it's a legitimate short here.

176
00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But, we then said, we looked at the monthly, weekly, and daily chart, and we said, what is the long term, intermediate, and short term auction direction of the crack spread?

177
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And the answer I got was what, Joe, up?

178
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
It was up, okay?

179
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We put the short on, and the short looked pretty good for about an hour and a half.

180
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And all of a sudden, I made the statement.

181
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You've got to remember, we are short against the trend.

182
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000
If you are short against the trend, you have to be right, and you have to be right very quickly.

183
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
The market went down for, if I think right, about an hour and a half.

184
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I remember it was B period.

185
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
All of a sudden, it left a buying tail of five or six ticks.

186
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You've already seen what a buying tail is.

187
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So, aggressive buying came in with the auction.

188
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We went back up, took the high, and we extended for the rest of the day.

189
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And today, we gapped higher.

190
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I guess it was a very big higher gap today.

191
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Those people yesterday, and I wish we could show that example today so it would stick with you,

192
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
because it feels so good to shorten higher prices.

193
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We were actually shorting the crack spread at higher prices than we've seen in some period of time.

194
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We're very close to it.

195
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And it started to work for us.

196
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So, when it starts to work for you, you're feeling pretty good, right?

197
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And we're looking to say, now wait a minute.

198
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We are short against the trend.

199
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So many people trade, and they have no idea what the trend is.

200
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
They have no idea what they're dealing with.

201
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
When that market turned around, the momentum traders came in, and it was gone.

202
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So, when you look at a trend, trading a trend day, you want to trade with the trend.

203
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
If you can't leave it alone, take profits on rallies, buy them back on breaks.

204
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And the trend day, we looked down here, we got a low.

205
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Did we one time frame?

206
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
We stopped one period.

207
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We stopped one time framing at one point in the trend day.

208
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Then it turned around and went the rest of the day.

209
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Remember, we said it is not uncommon in a trend day to have one period in which the market will balance.

210
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Okay?

211
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So, that's one type of a trend day.

212
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Let's take a look at the second type.

213
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
The second type is what we call a double distribution trend day.

214
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
A double distribution trend day will have a distribution down here.

215
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And if you were thinking about statistics or something, you'd have one node down here, or one distribution down here.

216
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And then, that distribution gets blown away midday or so, and it goes up and forms a whole new distribution.

217
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So, you're going to, if you take the total day, you're going to have two nodes that form that distribution.

218
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Let me ask you a question.

219
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:26.000
On a trend day that basically moves directionally all day, or a double distribution trend day, which of those trend days do you think emits the highest level of confidence?

220
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
The double distribution or the straight trend?

221
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It's the straight trend day.

222
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So, when you talk about thinking down the road, coming back, when the market is coming back the other way, the double distribution trend day has great, I'm not saying it's going to come back, but it presents greater odds that we'll retrace some of that range than does the trend day that moves directionally all day long.

223
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Again, those are nuances.

224
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Now, if you have a double distribution trend day, the second distribution of the double distribution trend day is usually a pretty reliable short term trading vehicle.

225
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So, if you look up here, we had the breakout was in I period to form the second distribution.

226
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:26.000
We had the pullback in M period, did not close the second distribution.

227
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
We're talking about reference points.

228
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Okay, when it didn't close and get back in that second distribution, that becomes a reference point.

229
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Okay, and at that point, that is very often a reliable place to buy a market.

230
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And I'm not saying there's other, there's other information that you need, but I'm just saying as we're going through this as a generality, it trades like it would an independent day.

231
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I treat a double distribution trend day as two separate days, two separate ranges.

232
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:10.000
If you have a double distribution trend day and you re-enter the lower distribution, that is usually fairly negative for at least the short term market information.

233
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Okay, let's take a look and then we have a balance day.

234
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
This is a balance day.

235
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
The, the, uh, the first price to do business is about in the center of the range.

236
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Um, you know, it's equal on both sides.

237
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:41.000
When a market is balanced, the message that a balanced market is delivering is the market saying it wants more information before it makes its next directional auction.

238
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Markets do speak to us.

239
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
We have to learn how to listen to the market speak.

240
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Structure is one way to do it.

241
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:02.000
The balance day is telling us that the market wants to listen, wants more information before it makes its next directional move.

242
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
The, um, what makes the market profile unique?

243
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
It's a couple of things.

244
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:18.000
It's the synthesis or it's the combining of all of these separate elements to form a whole.

245
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000
We saw the original graphic, the famous graphic of Napoleon going into Russia.

246
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
We saw how the size of the army diminished all the way along.

247
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
We saw the change in temperature.

248
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
We saw the change in food supplies.

249
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And it presented a pretty good whole as the whole campaign.

250
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Look at one famous graphic.

251
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
It presented a synthesis of the entire campaign.

252
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:56.000
However, the other thing about the graphic, the profile graphic, you can take it apart, you can take it apart and look at the separate pieces.

253
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Markets are very complicated.

254
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:11.000
We want to have the understanding of the whole, but at the same time, there is valuable information in the analysis of understanding the parts.

255
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Within the parts will be the nuances, right?

256
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
The nuances will be within the parts.

257
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So we separate it down.

258
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
It allows us to study the individual parts of the profile.

259
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
For example, when we're talking about a market that we had a profile where the market went down, made a low, and then one time framed up the rest of the day.

260
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Had you not separated that into parts, you would not have been able to ascertain that the market one time framed up after it made the low.

261
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You wouldn't have seen that.

262
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
By taking it apart, you see the pieces and you see what is happening after the low was made.

263
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And there is a logic to that, right?

264
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
The auction process that we use in trading stocks and futures is what direction?

265
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Up or down?

266
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Or two way?

267
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
It is a two way auction process.

268
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
In other words, it is continuous.

269
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
It auctions from low to high.

270
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
It auctions from high to low.

271
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
In that two way auction process is a continual search for information.

272
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Our job is to be able to extract the information that is contained within the two way auction process.

273
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
The best way we extract that information is by using the market profile to organize the data.

274
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000
One of the great mistakes, people get involved, they hear about market profile,

275
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
and they get involved and they start going to the internet and they start looking for words on market profile.

276
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Okay?

277
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And you then have a whole series of people out there that use my first book, Mind Over Markets,

278
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
as a basis for what they call their market profile site, or talking about the market profile.

279
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
They make it mechanical.

280
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
You buy here, you sell here, it doesn't work that way.

281
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
What we are talking about in this video is about trading.

282
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
We are talking about trading.

283
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:40.000
We are simply using the market profile to organize the data generated by the two way auction process in the market.

284
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:49.000
The profile does not tell you to buy, it does not tell you to sell, it doesn't do any of that.

285
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
It is very quiet.

286
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Okay?

287
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Now the database that forms it is dynamic because it changes throughout the day.

288
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
But when you start hearing people tell you, you know, you buy, you know, the profiles like this, you buy down here, sell up here.

289
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
It doesn't work that way.

290
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
That's a very mechanical approach to it.

291
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And it's so much more, it's so much more than looking at a profile.

292
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
We are talking about trading.

293
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And part of the reason that so many of my friends that are here today are here because they have been with us a long time.

294
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
They have gone through the process and they will understand that the profile is a very minor part.

295
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
We are talking about trading.

296
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:45.000
We are talking about, we haven't gotten there yet, but understanding how momentum traders differ from value traders.

297
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And if you don't understand, if you don't understand that, it's very hard to really successfully compete in the marketplace.

298
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
They understand that trading is a game.

299
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
You know, people like to make it a science.

300
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
It's not a science.

301
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
It is an art and there is an awful lot of gamesmanship that goes on.

302
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Other traders, hedge funds, people like this, they play games with the market.

303
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:18.000
If you don't understand the potential for that game, it's going to be very difficult for you to participate in this thing.

304
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
If you try and make it a science, it is going to be very frustrating to you.

305
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
That's the biggest transition people have to make, is understanding that it's not always predictable.

306
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Sometimes the real advantage comes from the fact that it's not predictable.

307
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And the opportunities sometimes will come out of absolutely nowhere.

308
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And then you say, how do I prepare myself for that?

309
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000
If you understand the market structure, you will have a much better understanding of how to take advantage of that.

310
00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:01.000
For example, if the market structure is really strong, and let's say the market structure is to the upside.

311
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And everybody gets all panicked on the last Friday of the month, or first Friday of the month, what do we have announced?

312
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
The jobs report, right?

313
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
And you get all the TV, they hype you up, and they, the jobs report, the jobs report, you're all focused on the jobs report.

314
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Well, if the underlying structure of the market is strong, and the jobs report, or the employment report comes out on that first Friday, and it's negative, guess what?

315
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Now, you may get a knee-jerk reaction to the downside from traders that don't know anybody, they're just selling the headline because they don't want to think.

316
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000
You get an initial reaction to the downside, and then even though the number was negative, you finish the day to the upside.

317
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And you say, well what happened? The number was negative.

318
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
We throw a word around a lot, we call cognitive dissonance.

319
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
It's absolutely one of the things that kills traders.

320
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
They hear the number, they hear the number is negative.

321
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
They couldn't trade objectively to the long side of the market following that, because cognitive dissonance is trying to hold two thoughts.

322
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000
The market structure may say the market's strong, but they've heard this, they've heard the commentator say the number's negative.

323
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
As if the commentator really knew. They don't know the adjustments or expectations or anything else.

324
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:41.000
But if you have an understanding that the market structure is strong, the number is negative, you get a little bounce down, structure supports it, and very often or not, the market will tear back to the opposite direction.

325
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
The market is strong, and it gets a number that is consistent with that.

326
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
You may get a market that just really accelerates to the upside.

327
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So, again, so much is based upon structure.

328
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
We've had, we had the break taking place not too long ago, and when that break was taking place, we were getting some awful good news.

329
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Okay? And why were we getting? Because the underlying structure wasn't very good.

330
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So, anyhow, the value profile, we can look at the market in total, or holistically, or we can take it apart and perform analysis.

331
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:28.000
We need to do both. Too much analysis, too much analysis, it will be very difficult to trade successfully.

332
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
No analysis, it will also be very difficult to trade successfully.

333
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
It is a combination of having a holistic understanding as well as an analytic understanding.

334
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Okay, let's kind of continue.

335
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Various structures, just a review.

336
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
We looked at the primary day, we used it as a benchmark.

337
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
We looked at a trend day.

338
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
We looked at a balance, kind of a squat day.

339
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
We looked at a short covering day.

340
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
So, these structures are all over the place.

341
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Within each structure, the market is talking to us differently, right?

342
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Just like years ago, it was on a very small basis, but when there used to be a lot of floor trading, the floor traders heard what was going on in the market.

343
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Now, we do it through sight.

344
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Okay?

345
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:36.000
We take a look, and this example, Billy Bob, you've been asking me about this example for some period of time.

346
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
I used to run an institutional trading desk.

347
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And having run an institutional trading desk, you learned an awful lot about how big money trades.

348
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:59.000
When big money comes into the market, they don't come into the market and buy all at once.

349
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:12.000
If I get an order on an institutional trading desk, whether it's in futures or stocks, if I go and buy all of what I'm supposed to buy at one time, guess what?

350
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
The chances that I'm going to give a customer the best fill of the day are pretty slim.

351
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
If I give them the best fill for the day, I got really lucky.

352
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I would prefer to give them an average fill.

353
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
If I give them an average fill, I'm never going to give them the best, right?

354
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
But I'm never going to give them the worst.

355
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And what you really don't want to do running an institutional desk, you never want to deliver the worst fill of the day to an institutional client.

356
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
You will never be forgotten, and you probably won't have that business going forward.

357
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
So, let's say they give me a couple of million shares to buy if it's stock.

358
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
What am I going to do?

359
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
In this case, let's say sell.

360
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
They're going to give me some to sell.

361
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I'll sell some early, so the market will break.

362
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I let the market settle.

363
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I sell some more.

364
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I let it settle.

365
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I sell some more.

366
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
It's more like a wave-like process.

367
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And usually, it's not just one institution.

368
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
A lot of times, you'll get a tone to a day, and that tone will continue throughout the day.

369
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
This is the S&Ps, April 30th of this year.

370
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
And as you can see, the high was made early.

371
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
The high was made early.

372
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
So, there was aggressiveness from the opening bell, right?

373
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
The market sold off.

374
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It balanced.

375
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
It sold off again.

376
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
It balanced.

377
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
It sold off.

378
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
It sold off again.

379
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
It was a wave-like action throughout the day.

380
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
That's kind of a standard.

381
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Now, sometimes, you'll get markets that just go straight down.

382
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I mean, they don't do any balancing.

383
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
That's probably long location.

384
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
That's probably fear.

385
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
These type of markets, when you have big money selling, will normally look something like this.

386
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Normally, like a wave kind of action.

387
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Again, another market that you don't want to go against.

388
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
We've seen this fairly recently.

389
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Anyhow, just an example.

390
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Billy Bob, I know you've asked me for this.

391
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Now you've got it.

392
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:31.000
We want to trade value, not price.

393
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
We'll see the slide again.

394
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
But think about any business.

395
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Price is an advertising mechanism.

396
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Time regulates all advertised opportunities.

397
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And volume measures the success or failure of all advertised opportunities.

398
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:08.000
When you put time, price, and volume together, when you get the composite, you have value.

399
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Biggest insult I can look to say to someone and see somebody that's trading and say, oh, you trade price.

400
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Well, how would you like to say, well, I trade an advertising mechanism?

401
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Sounds pretty silly, right?

402
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
But that's all price is.

403
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Price advertised is an opportunity.

404
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Some opportunities are accepted, right?

405
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Some opportunities are rejected.

406
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Value is kind of the composite of all of it.

407
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Before we took a break, we're talking about the value area, and we trade value, not price.

408
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:50.000
I will promise you the most difficult thing that you will deal with, if you get interested in what we're talking about, is getting away from price.

409
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
It is addictive.

410
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Our minds like price because it does linear, right?

411
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
It goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

412
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Boy, and we get so focused on it, we get hunched over the machine.

413
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
The killer is getting trapped by price.

414
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
It is addictive.

415
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
It pulls you into it.

416
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I see Rue in the back.

417
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Rue is from Phoenix.

418
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
He's a tennis pro.

419
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Came out and traded with me one day.

420
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And one of the comments he made was, wow.

421
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
He said, I can't believe it.

422
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
He said, you sit back when you trade.

423
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
And he said, you're taking in the full landscape.

424
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And it's that taking in the landscape that he coined that allows me to stay away from getting trapped by price.

425
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Sometimes I get tense.

426
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
If I get tense, I tend to, you know, kind of cuddle up the machine.

427
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
You start to cuddle up the machine.

428
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:55.000
You get overly focused on price, and you can't believe the mistakes you make because you lose the bigger perspective of what is going on.

429
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Alright, let's take a look at some of the value area relationships.

430
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000
In here, all we're looking, we have lower value, higher value.

431
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Overlapping to lower value.

432
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Clearly higher value, clearly higher value.

433
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Notice the difference value.

434
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:26.000
You can have, we'll look later on, you can have situations where price is higher and value is lower.

435
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Or price is lower and value is higher.

436
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:39.000
When I knew that I was really making the transition to internalizing this information, and that's really what it's about.

437
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Getting to the level where you've internalized the information.

438
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
When somebody would ask me, what did the market do today?

439
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.000
The standard, if I trade S&Ps, the standard answer might have been, oh, we were up, we were up six and a half today.

440
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:05.000
When I knew I had started to internalize the information, somebody would ask me that, and the first thing coming out of my head would be, value was higher today.

441
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And of course, you know, when you're talking to someone that has no idea what you're talking about, that is not an answer that gets a lot of appreciation and they have no idea what you're talking about.

442
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
But I knew that I was really starting to take this information to the next level.

443
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
So we're always looking at value.

444
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:38.000
We said earlier that one of the things that we're trying to do is visualize what the profile looks like before the day is over.

445
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
We said the key is to visualize, not predict.

446
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000
But along with that, I'm always looking to see what kind of value am I going to have today.

447
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I'm going to have higher value, lower value, unchanged value, overlapping value.

448
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
We were doing the live trading, as I mentioned yesterday morning.

449
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And part of the process that we went through was looking and saying, okay, say price opened higher and it's starting to go lower and you have a trade that looks like a good short.

450
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
And you say, oh, wait a minute.

451
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Price is trying to go lower, but from where price is right now, what is the likelihood that we can even get unchanged value?

452
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And when all of a sudden we were saved on a couple of trades, we said, you know, we're an hour and a half into the day.

453
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
There is no way that we're going to get unchanged value.

454
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
We could get lower price, but we're not going to get unchanged value.

455
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And in those markets where we made those observations before the day was over, the market turned around and went directionally with value, not in the same direction that price initially went.

456
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Let's take a couple of examples.

457
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Let's start over here on the left.

458
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Here's our value.

459
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Down here we have lower value and we're looking at lower value, lower value and lower price.

460
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
We come up here.

461
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
The next we have higher value, higher price.

462
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000
The following day we have overlapping to higher value, but we have lower, lower price.

463
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
So when you go through this, you have all of these combinations and permutations that can take place.

464
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
They are very meaningful.

465
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:54.000
As you gain experience and you start to understand the difference between price and value, the question that you're always going to be dealing with, when price is away from value, the question is, will price get pulled back to value?

466
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Or will value get pulled to price?

467
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
That's the basic analytic question you're looking at.

468
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:13.000
When you come in, for example, early on, we showed where the point of control did not migrate lower.

469
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
If you remember, we had the 45 degree line and we said people were getting caught short in the hole.

470
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
I sent the email out that there may be a short covering trap.

471
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
What was the issue I was dealing with?

472
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:39.000
The issue was, was price going to get pulled back to value or was value going to be pulled down to price?

473
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
When we looked and we saw the fairest price to conduct business was not migrating lower.

474
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
The chances were that price was going to snap back to where value was.

475
00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Well, if you don't have any idea of the concept of price and value, you're never going to be able to make that analysis when you're trading the market.

476
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:19.000
And if you don't think there's a difference between price and value, go out and next time you buy a car, whatever the sticker price says, if it's American car, whatever the sticker price says, just write the check.

477
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Just write the check, right?

478
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
How many people are going to do that?

479
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Because do you see price and value as being the same?

480
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:35.000
You know, a lot of times you will pass something up because you look at the price, but you don't think the price offers value.

481
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Other times you will snap something up very quickly, right?

482
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Because you think, wow, that is a value situation.

483
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I made the comment earlier that I marvel at people that have been extremely successful in business.

484
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I'm talking extremely successful in business.

485
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
They will come in and they want to talk about learning to trade futures.

486
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:07.000
But yet they will not employ the same principles that they employed in business in trading the market.

487
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
They want to just look at price.

488
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000
I look at them and say, wait a minute, in business, no two prices were equal, right?

489
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
And it's not in the market.

490
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
But so many people have talked to them about price and so many books they've read talk about price.

491
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000
They get sucked into price and they lose the idea of the concept of the difference between price and value.

492
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
You make money.

493
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
You make money by buying something below value or selling it above value.

494
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
You also make money in a trend.

495
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:51.000
You also make money in a trend when you have a pretty good idea that you're ahead of the market and a pretty good idea that value is going to come up to meet your price.

496
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Those are the two decisions that you need to make.

497
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Historically, when you first start to read books on trading and start learning about trading, most people introduce you to reversion to the mean type of trades.

498
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Okay?

499
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
They feel intuitively good.

500
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
And in some markets, they are wonderful.

501
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
But that is when price is going to get pulled back to value.

502
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
When you have a new trend taking place, price is leading value.

503
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And when price is leading value, those are the biggest opportunities.

504
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
They are the most uncomfortable trades to make.

505
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:47.000
If you have a breakout or you have a trend that begins where price is leading value, you're going to have to pay 12 for something that you could have paid 10 for yesterday.

506
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
That intuitively doesn't feel good to us.

507
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.000
However, very often when the trend develops, there is less risk.

508
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:07.000
There is less risk in paying 12 for something than there is in paying 10 for it because price is leading value.

509
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
You're moving away from one distribution into another distribution.

510
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Amateur traders very often can't make that determination.

511
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Season traders know that intuitively.

512
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000
But one of the things, what you really want to focus on in this area right now is thinking about the difference of price and value.

513
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
In some cases, price will revert back to value.

514
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
In other cases, price will lead value.

515
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
If price is leading value, would you expect volume to be increasing or decreasing?

516
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Increasing, right?

517
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.000
If I raise the price of a product that I'm selling and my volume stays the same or increases, guess what?

518
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
I got a trend going and it's very successful.

519
00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And if I raise the price of something, my volume increases or stays the same before long, what am I going to do again?

520
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I'm going to raise the price again, right?

521
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Guess what we call that?

522
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
We call it a trend.

523
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Okay, so these relationships are very, very important.

524
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:26.000
You'll get price in the morning that opens within yesterday's range, outside of yesterday's range, within yesterday's value, outside of yesterday's value.

525
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Those are all extremely important relationships that you want to be aware of.

526
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:46.000
When price opens right within the previous day's range, the previous day's value, what do you think the opportunity is?

527
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Small opportunity.

528
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
It's going to be a small opportunity, absolutely.

529
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
When price opens outside of value and outside of the range, the opportunity is much greater.

530
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Even if it's an opportunity to continue in the way it opened or an opportunity to snap back to where value was, it's still going to be a bigger opportunity.

531
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Okay.

532
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:23.000
When we look at the far side, when we look at these relationships on the far side, we have price above value.

533
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
At that point in time, price closes higher, however value is actually lower.

534
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
The opportunity now is really the question we addressed.

535
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Will price get pulled back to value or will value get pulled up to price?

536
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:48.000
A lot of that is going to depend upon how prominent and how well designed the actual value area and the structure was.

537
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
It takes a lot to get away from a well-defined value or structural area.

538
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Okay.

539
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
So the question is, when price and value don't agree, we are looking at different variations of opportunities.

540
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
The pit session openings.

541
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
What I'm going to do here, I'm going to talk about four types of openings.

542
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:24.000
After we talk about these, we're then going to go to today's market and see if we see these relationships any place in today's market and how we would make use of them.

543
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
The first type of opening is an open and drive.

544
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:38.000
In an opening drive, price is basically on the low or the high of the day, depending on the direction of the auction.

545
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
The market opens.

546
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Price moves aggressively from the opening bell.

547
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:51.000
The trading community or the investors knew what they wanted to do from the opening bell.

548
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
It is very aggressive.

549
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
It moves very quickly.

550
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
It is the highest confidence opening you will see.

551
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:09.000
The higher the confidence of the opening, the less the odds that you will come back through that opening price.

552
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
And we're always talking about odds and confidence when we trade a market.

553
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
We saw this yesterday.

554
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
We had a market yesterday.

555
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
It opened.

556
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
It was back and forth through the opening multiple times.

557
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
We said the confidence was very low.

558
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
We said the confidence was very low.

559
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Guess what?

560
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I don't have to trade early, right?

561
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
When the confidence is high, I need to trade quickly.

562
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:44.000
A lot of times, I get people asking me the question, well, Jim, I've heard people say I should trade later in the day after the market has set up.

563
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
And I say, no, I don't buy into any of that.

564
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You need to trade.

565
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
You need to trade when the confidence is there, whether that happens early or late.

566
00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000
In an open and dry, high confidence market, you tell me, do you want to trade early or do you want to trade late?

567
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
You want to trade early.

568
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
You want to get on the vehicle that's moving at that point in time.

569
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Just get on.

570
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Don't be a perfectionist.

571
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Don't nitpick it.

572
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Don't get on to get on to the market, particularly if you're short term trader.

573
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Okay.

574
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
So for the first time we have an opening drive, usually the opening will be on or very close to the low for the day.

575
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000
The second highest confidence opening is an open test drive.

576
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So in this case, the market opens.

577
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
It opens right here where the circle is.

578
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
It opens test lower.

579
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
And when it tests lower, it finds buyers.

580
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Very often in an open and test type of market situation, the test lower will go to some reference point that you could define.

581
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
That reference point may be a pull back low.

582
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It may be a previous point of control.

583
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
It may be a previous days high or low.

584
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
It may be a monthly or weekly high or low.

585
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
But it will generally go to some reference point.

586
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
So it tests.

587
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
In other words, tests lower.

588
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Very often it will test to a reference point.

589
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
And once you get to that reference point, you find there are buyers in the market.

590
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Once you find there are buyers in the market, the market then continues in the opposite direction for most of the day.

591
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Second highest confidence opening you will have.

592
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Okay.

593
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Our third type is an open rejection reverse.

594
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:52.000
In other words, in this case, the opening usually trades in the opposite direction from what the day will be for an extended period of time.

595
00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:03.000
In other words, if the opening, in this case, if the opening and test was higher, when the market is going higher, what is it searching for?

596
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
It's searching for sellers.

597
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Absolutely.

598
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Okay.

599
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:17.000
In an open rejection reverse, it just simply had to go a whole lot higher before it attracted the sellers.

600
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:25.000
But once they got to that level, the sellers came in fairly aggressively and then took the market in the opposite direction.

601
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
So when you're talking about confidence, open and drive, highest confidence.

602
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Open test drive, second highest confidence.

603
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Open rejection reverse, third level confidence.

604
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:45.000
The level of confidence just tells you what are the chances that this market is going to come back at you before the day is over.

605
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000
And now let's look at the last type of confidence, which is the lowest confidence opening.

606
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
The lowest confidence opening is called an open auction.

607
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000
In other words, the market goes back and forth through the opening price multiple times.

608
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
In other words, what do you think?

609
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000
If it goes back and forth through the opening price multiple times, what do you think the level of conviction is?

610
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
It's pretty low.

611
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
It's pretty low.

612
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Do you need to trade early or late?

613
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Trade late.

614
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Trade late.

615
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Absolutely.

616
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Trade late.

617
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Relax.

618
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Let the market come to you.

619
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Here's the difference.

620
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:29.000
In an open auction, low confidence, sit back, let the market come to you.

621
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
In a high confidence open, you have to go to the market, right?

622
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So you see the differences in there.

623
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Now, let's take this one step.

624
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Let's take this one step further.

625
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
When you, and let's look at today's markets.

626
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Let's start with the bonds.

627
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Okay?

628
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Now, on the right hand side, you have the first period in bonds.

629
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
There's the opening right in the middle.

630
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Okay?

631
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
What kind of an opening do you think I have in bonds today?

632
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Open auction, right?

633
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Back and forth through the auction, through the opening many times.

634
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
So what do you think the opportunity is?

635
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Big or small right away?

636
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Small.

637
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Small, right?

638
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Okay?

639
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Let the market come, let the market come to me, right?

640
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
We've now traded for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

641
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
We're in the eighth time period.

642
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
And guess what?

643
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Has any confidence developed yet?

644
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
No confidence at all, right?

645
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
So I probably still haven't had a trade.

646
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Now, while we're looking at it, can you put the cursor on unchanged from yesterday?

647
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Right there.

648
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
See that level right there?

649
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
That's unchanged from yesterday.

650
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
We're talking about nuances here.

651
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
I didn't intend to talk about this, but it's up here.

652
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000
This is real.

653
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
This is a live market today.

654
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
One of the major references short-term traders will use is unchanged.

655
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:04.000
When a market goes up and it can't get to unchanged, okay, can't get to unchanged, what's it going to do next more than likely?

656
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Look at A period.

657
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
It got up.

658
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
It got what?

659
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
One tick short of unchanged?

660
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
It couldn't make unchanged.

661
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Where did the auction go next?

662
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
It went down and it looked right at this morning's opening.

663
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Went to the opening.

664
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
How many people, you know, most people don't understand.

665
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:29.000
That opening price, unchanged, they are tremendous short-term indicators to understand what's going on.

666
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Now, we've got the market.

667
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
It went back up, couldn't make unchanged, coming back down.

668
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Nothing going on in the 30-year treasury bonds, at least at this point.

669
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Okay?

670
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Nothing major.

671
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Alright, let's take a look at, what's the next market we want to bring up?

672
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Crude.

673
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Okay, let's take a look at crude.

674
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Crude opened at where you see the ACD.

675
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Okay?

676
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Pretty quiet early on.

677
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Then, crude rallied to the upside.

678
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Okay?

679
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Crude rallied.

680
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000
There's the opening.

681
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
There's the A period.

682
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
There's the B period.

683
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
C period.

684
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
So the opening was down early on.

685
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
This is yesterday's range.

686
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Are we in or out of yesterday's range on crude?

687
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
We're in.

688
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
We're in yesterday's range.

689
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Okay?

690
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
So now, let's add more complexity to it.

691
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:33.000
So I take the opening and I put the opening inside of yesterday's, inside of yesterday's range.

692
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
See the blue line there?

693
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000
The blue line is value area from yesterday, where 70% of yesterday's trade took place.

694
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.000
We open outside of value, but we open within yesterday's range.

695
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
First period auctioned down, but in range.

696
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Okay?

697
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
In range, opportunity more than likely, big or small?

698
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Small.

699
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Probably small.

700
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
We open down and then the market in B period went down.

701
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Tried to look at yesterday's low.

702
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Right?

703
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Did it get it?

704
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Didn't get it.

705
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Okay?

706
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Didn't get that.

707
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Now it's going to auction higher again.

708
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Okay?

709
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Then it goes up and it gets to yesterday's.

710
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Guess what that level is?

711
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000
See that low up there?

712
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
That BCD?

713
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
We talked about that yesterday afternoon in the live trading seminar.

714
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
We call that, it's an anomaly.

715
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Or that was another way, it was the point of control.

716
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000
It was also the fairest price to do business.

717
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Okay?

718
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Most people would have no idea about that silly little price.

719
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Or that silly little anomaly.

720
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
That was the fairest price at which business was being conducted yesterday.

721
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Look at the close yesterday, it was down here.

722
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
The close was down there.

723
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Okay?

724
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
What happened?

725
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
We talked early on, we introduced a subject called repair early on.

726
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Right?

727
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
We went back and revisited that part of the structure.

728
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000
That part of the structure, that anomaly, the market was having trouble moving away from that.

729
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Even though price came lower, it went back and revisited that part of yesterday's structure.

730
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Does it look like an anomaly?

731
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
A rough edge?

732
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Does it stick out differently than anything else you see?

733
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Now, are you going to, the first day you start to use this, are you going to really pick up on that?

734
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Probably not.

735
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I said, nuances are important.

736
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Most people, if they heard me talking about that, and I'm going to guess that yesterday,

737
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
when we were in here yesterday, and I kept pointing out this price late in the day.

738
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:44.000
I'm going to guess that even seasoned people that I've worked with for a long period of time,

739
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
were probably kind of shaking their head and saying,

740
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
it's one price, it really is making a big deal out of something.

741
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Let's move on.

742
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Okay?

743
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
And we trade down here.

744
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
And it took a while, but look what it did today.

745
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
That's a nuance.

746
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
That is a nuance.

747
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Okay?

748
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
We started talking about the openings.

749
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000
First we said, open within yesterday's range, opportunity probably big or small.

750
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Probably small, right?

751
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Okay?

752
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
And it was, right?

753
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
We auctioned a little higher, a little lower.

754
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000
We went down, we didn't take the low, we walked auctioned a little higher.

755
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Then we went back up and checked out that price in D period.

756
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Then the market broke on the downside.

757
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Again, I had some information based upon where the market opened.

758
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
And yes, the market opened, contextually, the market opened and drove lower.

759
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Let's look at the opening one more time this morning, please.

760
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Okay?

761
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
The opens on the high.

762
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
So we opened and we drove lower, right?

763
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
So you say, oh, wait a minute.

764
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
It's an open and drive.

765
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
But the context is different.

766
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
It's opened and drive and it's within yesterday's range.

767
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Opportunity is small.

768
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Then it doesn't get the low.

769
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
If it doesn't get the low or the single, the buying tail from yesterday, first time,

770
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
what's going to happen?

771
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000
This means sell.

772
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
It gets down there and doesn't get it.

773
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
If you were still on the floor, hands would be out.

774
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
We'd start auctioning higher.

775
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Okay.

776
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000
So we looked at the bond opening, which was an open auction back and forth, no confidence,

777
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
eight periods in, no options.

778
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
If I, let's say I had a market and I have a five month high.

779
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Okay?

780
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Do you think the short term trader has any interest in taking the market out of a five month high?

781
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
It's not what they do.

782
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.000
However, the intermediate term trader or the long term trader might have an interest in

783
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000
that.

784
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:52.000
So when I start to see a four or five month high and I go outside of that range, that gives

785
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000
me information that the participation in the market is by longer, more serious time frames.

786
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:07.000
A long time frame ends, a long term trend ends or terminates in an intermediate term trend.

787
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:14.000
An intermediate term trader is a relatively substantial trader.

788
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
They're what we may call swing traders.

789
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:24.000
They may trade from the top to the bottom of a very wide trading range in there.

790
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:31.000
You will also have short term trends within the intermediate term trends.

791
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
You have the long term trend.

792
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
You have intermediate term trends.

793
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
You have short term trends and then day time frame trades within the short term trends.

794
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000
So it gets fairly complex in there.

795
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
But you hear all the time.

796
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
You know, you have the long term, long term trend is up.

797
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000
You get a correction.

798
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
You get a correction, you know, to the long term trend.

799
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000
So it may be a short term trend that's correcting the long term trend.

800
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Happens all the time.

801
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So the intermediate term trend may be people like John Henry, who's a major hedge fund up in Connecticut.

802
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Maybe some of the Morningstar mutual funds.

803
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Barclays, alternative investment people, DB advisors from Deutsche Bank,

804
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
people that are in the hedge fund or alternative investment world.

805
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
These are, you know, they're relatively big players.

806
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
They tend to be fast players.

807
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
They have quite a bit of money at stake.

808
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
They employ quite a bit of leverage in the game.

809
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And they're meaningful.

810
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
When they're in the market, they can move the market.

811
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
But this group is not responsible for moving the market to new highs and new lows, right?

812
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That's not what they do.

813
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The long term traders, which our last group, will be people like Fidelity, JP Morgan, Vanguard, Invesco.

814
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
These are just examples.

815
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
These are just examples of the long term traders or the sticky money traders.

816
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
When they come in the market, they come in in size.

817
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
They come in in size and they really start to pressure a market either up or down.

818
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Their orders, the size of these orders are so big, they may exist for multiple days.

819
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
They may be working a position for multiple days.

820
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I said I used to run an institutional trading desk.

821
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
We may get orders that we're working for a substantial period of time.

822
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We're continually buying.

823
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
We're buying every pullback and we may be buying it for days.

824
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Okay?

825
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So part of your understanding of the markets is understanding when these kind of people, what time frame is in the market.

826
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And like I say, you will spend a lifetime wrestling with these issues and what time frame is in control.

827
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It is extremely important to you being a successful trader.

828
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
We talk about the time it takes to assimilate the knowledge we're talking about.

829
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It is substantial.

830
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It is substantial.

831
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
People that come in and think, I have people all the time say, well Jim, I'm smarter than the average.

832
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I want the three month course.

833
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Or don't you have a six month course?

834
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You know, I just laugh when I say, it's been really very, very nice to meet you.

835
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But I'm not going to be able to help you.

836
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You're going to be frustrated with you.

837
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
When you get into this, guess what?

838
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
When we're talking about this, you're starting to feel a lot of ambiguity.

839
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Okay?

840
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Do people like ambiguity?

841
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
They loathe it, right?

842
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
They want an answer.

843
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Jim, what's the market going to do?

844
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I'm a reporter from CNBC.

845
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Well, which way, what do you think the last hour of trading is going to look like today?

846
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
How high is it going?

847
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
That's what people want to know, right?

848
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Watch one of those anchors when somebody says, I have no idea.

849
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
They're just dying with their mic, right?

850
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Because that's not the way they answer.

851
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Years ago, they used to have a, used to be around the Merck and the S&P pit.

852
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
One of the local radio stations came after me and they wanted me to broadcast up there for them.

853
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
For five minutes in the morning and five minutes on the drive home.

854
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
We're after the markets are closed.

855
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I said, guys, you're not going to want me.

856
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I said, if you, if you hire me to do this, within a month, you're going to be very apologetic.

857
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
You're going to be singing and dancing and trying to get out of this.

858
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
No, no, no.

859
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
We've got a lot of requests.

860
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I said, believe me.

861
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I said, the drive home will be okay.

862
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So anyhow, I went ahead and did it.

863
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And of course, it's a month later.

864
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Their readers are irate.

865
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
They are irate.

866
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
They want to know where do I buy it?

867
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Where do I sell it?

868
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And I may tell them, I may be up there and say, this is an extremely low confidence day.

869
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I see no opportunities in here today in this S&P market.

870
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Boy, that goes over big, doesn't it?

871
01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Now, the drive home people that listened were from the floor.

872
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
They had a better understanding.

873
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So my ratings for the drive home was fine.

874
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Mid-morning, what do I buy?

875
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
What do I sell?

876
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
They couldn't get me out of there fast enough.

877
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And that's what happens with a lot of the S&P.

878
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
As we get into the more complex stuff, there is a tremendous amount of ambiguity.

879
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And it's that, within that ambiguity, are the real opportunities.

880
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Those that can, I think, can get through it.

881
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Anyhow, timeframe behavior.

882
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It reveals itself as the sessions unfold.

883
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Talking about who's in control of a market.

884
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:59.000
If, in fact, a market goes exactly to last night's close, or exactly to yesterday's high, or exactly to yesterday's low, or exactly halfway back in the morning, do you think that's the long timeframe?

885
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Do you think they're the longest timeframe?

886
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Do you even think they know what unchanged is and all?

887
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
They don't know.

888
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Do you think it's the intermediate timeframe?

889
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
They could care less.

890
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
They have no idea.

891
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
A lot of these big firms, they don't even have bar charts in their shops.

892
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Now, when you start getting down, it goes exactly to unchanged, exactly to the day's opening, exactly to the high and the low.

893
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Who do you think is dominating the market?

894
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
What timeframe?

895
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Probably the daytime frame trader, right?

896
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Okay.

897
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000
The characteristics and the behavior of the daytime frame trader is substantially different than the behavior of the next longest timeframe.

898
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000
The daytime frame trader, well, probably, if that's who's dominating the market, then what you're trying to do very early, figure out who's dominating the market.

899
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
The daytime frame trader, they will buy yesterday's high, they'll sell yesterday's low.

900
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
The long timeframe or longer timeframe, they could care less.

901
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So you start very quickly to understand who's dominating the market today, who's dominating the market, starts to help you identify what your opportunities are.

902
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:22.120
As you start thinking about doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of things on doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts of doing all sorts doing all sorts of doing all sorts doing all sorts doing all sorts doing all sorts doing all sorts doing all sorts doing all sorts doing all
